00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.003
Whatever the Founding Fathers imagined
politics would look like 250 years later.

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:03.937
I can tell you one thing.

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:04.938
This is not it.

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:06.906
How many of Epstein's coconspirators.

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:08.108
Have you indicted?

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:11.511
How many perpetrators are
you even investigating?

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.146
First

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.214
you showed it.

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:16.850
I find out how many have you use me?

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.552
I'm going to answer the question.
Answer my question.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:19.719
Okay.

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:22.622
I'm going to answer the question
the way I want to answer the question.

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:24.357
You can ask the question. I ask you.

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:27.360
You can let her filibuster all day long,
but not on our watch.

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:30.163
And I told you about that attorney general
before you started.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:33.800
Don't tell me I didn't tell you
because I saw what you did in the Senate.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.568
Lawyer? Not even a lawyer.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:40.473
You know, with this anti-Semitic culture
right now, she voted against a resolution.

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.008
Contempt, condemning.

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:42.876
Oh, yes.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.844
You want to be clear?

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.180
You want to go there, Attorney General?

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.149
Do you want to go there?

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.385
Are you long for the gentleman
talking about anti-Semitism?

00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:56.322
To a woman who lost her grandfather in the
hurricane of my time, I see it little.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.225
So that's Donald Trump, attorney
General Pam Bondi

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.094
taking an absolute
beating in front of the House

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:03.763
Judiciary Committee today with her being
the head of the Trump Justice Department.

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:05.965
The topic that everyone grilled her
on was Jeffrey Epstein, though

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:07.600
it seems like
that may not be clear to Bundy

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.803
because almost every time
someone asked her about it,

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.071
she deflected to something else.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:15.241
Be it the Democrats illegal immigrants,
deep fake pointer that Ukrainian refugees

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.643
stabbed on a train last August.

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:17.377
You know, instead

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:20.580
of talking about girls and Maxwell,
who hopefully will die in prison,

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:22.515
hopefully will die in prison.

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:23.917
I have all I can about our arenas.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:26.686
Rick Scott.
I have a couple died on the subway.

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:28.221
No way that she tried to make it out
like Trump's

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.423
been the one that's
actually been pushing to release the file.

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:33.693
This has been around
since the Obama administration.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.932
This administration
released over 3 million pages

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:41.301
of documents, over 3 million.

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.503
And Donald Trump signed that.

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:44.104
Law, though,

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:47.006
that, of course, it flies in the face
of almost an entire year of foot

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.743
dragging lies, distractions, and countless
deployments of the word hoax

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:51.644
that we all witness.

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:52.378
They think you're stupid.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:53.980
They think you have the memory
of a goldfish.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.783
But then also you had Bondi arguing
that nobody asked all these questions

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.518
when Biden's attorney general
was on the stand.

00:01:58.518 --> 00:01:59.319
And the Democrats,

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.887
they actually only care about Epstein now

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:03.490
because they want to distract from Trump's
stock market.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.792
The Dow is over $50,000.

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.026
I don't know why you're laughing.

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:09.696
You're a great stock trader,
as I hear. Raskin.

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:13.533
The Dow is over 50,000 right now.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.836
The S&amp;P at almost 7000.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.039
We should be talking about what does
the Dow have to do with anything.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.441
That's what they just ask.

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:22.742
Are you kidding?

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:26.546
Now that of course it flies in the face
of numerous economic indicators inflation,

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:30.350
jobs numbers, debt, health insurance
premiums, as well as Trump's dismissal

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.918
of polling on economic performance.

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.820
But he's been out there saying
that if you don't like the economy, you're

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.157
essentially crazy that affordability,
it's a Democratic hoax.

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.425
Not that, again,
any of this is relevant to Epstein.

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:40.560
And also, I know we've just

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.563
collectively forgotten this, but
Pam Bondi is not a political operative.

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.064
She is the attorney general.

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:48.601
Like I know Trump destroyed,
killed, drowned.

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:52.705
Norm's in a bathtub, but
her role is supposed to be nonpartisan,

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.607
nonpolitical, independent
from the white House.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:56.676
And so for anyone who remembers
what American politics

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.077
was just like a couple of years ago,

00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:01.814
seeing America's top lawyer glaze
Trump from head to toe is kind of wild.

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:03.783
Not surprising, but just wild.

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:07.253
But anyway, going back to Epstein,
a group of his victims were actually there

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:10.456
at the hearing, and Pramila
Jayapal had them stand up and then said.

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:15.161
And if you are willing,
please raise your hands if you have still

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:19.566
not been able to meet
with this Department of Justice.

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:23.336
Please know for the record, that
every single survivor has raised

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.970
their hand.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.705
Also, at another point,
after Bondi licked Trump's

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:28.808
toes on national television a little more
and claim that there's no evidence

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:32.278
he's committed any crimes, Ted Lieu
leveled this serious accusation at her.

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:34.280
I believe you just lied under oath.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.416
There is ample evidence into Epstein.

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.651
Don't you ever accuse me of a.

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:40.653
I believe you just lied under oath.

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:42.155
And this is on videotape.

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:44.123
You said there's no evidence of crime.

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:47.260
I'm showing you
here is a witness statement.

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:50.296
Who called in to the FBI street
operations Center.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.366
He drove Donald Trump around in a limo.

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:57.604
He overheard Donald Trump said to Jeffrey
on his cell phone, he was so angry.

00:03:57.604 --> 00:04:00.340
He was in a stop
a limo and hurt Donald Trump.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.310
And he met a girl who said she was raped
by Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:08.147
She later had her head
blown off, and officers at the scene

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:10.516
said that could not have been suicide.

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:12.852
You also get Thomas Massie, who's
been leading the charge in the release

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:15.188
of the Epstein Files
with Roxana calling her out first

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:17.156
for accidentally
publishing the names of victims

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:19.492
and then for redacting the names
of implicated men.

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:24.597
To my right is an email that was sent
by the victim's lawyers to the DOJ.

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:27.600
It was a list of names not to redact

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.670
or sorry, a list of names not to release.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.006
What did the DOJ do with this email?

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:37.076
They released this email in the document
production.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.446
Literally the worst thing
you could do to the survivors.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.181
Then you had Massey
pulling up another document

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:44.117
referring to Coconspirators
in sex trafficking,

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:46.085
and he noted
that while billionaire Wexner,

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:49.022
his name was found in other parts
of the files, it was redacted there.

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:52.292
Wexler's name was unredacted after
he called it out earlier in the week.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.160
Today, you got to directly confront Bondy

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.163
about it, though she didn't really know
in surprise, just brushed it off.

00:04:57.163 --> 00:05:02.101
Who in your organization made this massive
failure and released the victims names?

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:06.572
Are you able to track who it was
that obscured less?

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:11.044
Wexner his name as a coconspirator
in an FBI document?

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:14.213
Do you have that kind of accountability?

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.116
I believe Wexner, his

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:20.953
name was listed more than 4000 times about
I had.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.822
Yeah, I already told you that
if you're acting like

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:25.024
everybody is trying to cover up
Wexner his name.

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:25.591
Reclaiming.

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:28.594
Reclaiming my time in answer
this, reclaiming my time.

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:29.629
He was Mr.

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:32.632
Chairman. All this work within 40 minutes.

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:34.901
Wexner s name was added back then.

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:37.737
40 minutes of me catching you red handed.

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:40.740
Read. He chose one redaction.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.176
I know he's listed as a coconspirator.

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:46.346
And so with all this, unsurprisingly,
especially if you watched the whole thing,

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:49.148
you've had some slamming body
not only for not answering questions,

00:05:49.148 --> 00:05:51.884
but some even calling for her
to be held in contempt of Congress.

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:54.153
But also, you know, the DOJ,
they're not the only department

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:55.755
that has a problem
with the abuse of children, right?

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:57.857
Because Homeland Security
has now been accused of zip tying

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:01.160
dozens of kids during a raid in October
on a horse racing track in Idaho.

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:04.731
Now, officially, they were targeting an
alleged gambling ring with some 300 U.S.

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.700
citizens and 100 undocumented immigrants
getting taken into custody.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.335
But only five
people were actually arrested

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:11.504
for the gambling ring,
all on nonviolent offenses.

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:13.873
And now you have the ACLU
alleging in a lawsuit

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:16.142
that the whole thing was just a cover
for an immigration

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:18.311
raid, describing
how in the process of rounding people up

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:21.347
and hurting them out of the racing
track, better late in smashed car windows

00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:23.383
where children had taken refuge
from a chilly rain,

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.051
one eight year old boy
saying that he had to pick

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.453
tiny shards of glass
out of his mouth, other kids adding

00:06:27.453 --> 00:06:29.922
that guns were pointed at them
more, recalling rubber bullets

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:31.057
whizzing over their heads.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:31.924
And according to the lawsuit,

00:06:31.924 --> 00:06:34.494
multiple kids were zip tie,
leaving welts and bruises on the wrist,

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:36.262
including a 14 year old girl
seen in this photo.

00:06:36.262 --> 00:06:39.265
Now, both Trump's DHS
and the local FBI office and flat out deny

00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:40.500
that any kids were zip tied.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.100
But later

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.904
you had some FBI officials clarifying
that no young children were zip tie,

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:45.972
but then you also had local

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:49.108
police acknowledging that, in fact,
yes, minors had been zip tie.

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:51.878
And this week you had CBS news
confronting the sheriff who led the raid.

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:54.180
And also,
just to give you an idea of his character,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.483
he did the operation on horseback
and describes himself as a cowboy.

00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:59.819
But anyway,
he essentially played the playbook, right?

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:02.855
At first he denied it, and when they fact
checked him right there on the spot,

00:07:03.022 --> 00:07:05.024
he just tried to justify
there were kids in there.

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:07.427
They weren't zipped.
Those little ones were not zip tied.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:10.129
This is a picture of Sue. Hey,
we met her this morning.

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:11.264
She's 14 years old.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:11.664
Okay?

00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:15.334
She's a, I would say a child, a girl
who is zip tied.

00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:19.205
And these are the bruises from those
zip ties, and I, we've seen that or heard.

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:20.840
No, I had not I had not seen that.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.875
But I will tell you this.

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:25.011
I've been in this business a long time.

00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:28.014
I have gone against gang members
who are a lot younger than that.

00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:31.651
She was with her six year old brother
and eight year old sister.

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:34.587
But you're taking that out of context.

00:07:34.587 --> 00:07:37.190
We do not know what's next. You need
do not know.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.760
With two small children with her,
how dangerous could she possibly be?

00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:41.260
We don't know.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.297
But that's only one of many cases
where the authorities were caught lying.

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:45.598
Which actually, speaking on that,

00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:48.601
we've got to dive into these revelations
about Murray and Martinez.

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:49.969
We talked about her in depth last week.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:52.772
She's a woman who survived being shot
by Border Patrol five times.

00:07:52.772 --> 00:07:54.006
While she was following them in her car.

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:57.310
I could hear my back passenger
when the window shattered.

00:07:57.343 --> 00:08:00.513
I looked down and I noticed blood
not on my arms and legs.

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:02.215
And we thought you were the agents
claiming afterward

00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:04.917
that she rammed their car. And Martinez.
She claimed the opposite.

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:07.553
She said they sideswiped her
before getting out and shooting.

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:09.522
Well, now we have the bodycam footage
from that incident,

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:11.457
and it doesn't appear
to back up the agent's story,

00:08:11.457 --> 00:08:13.392
but it starts with them in their vehicle,
protesters

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:15.528
honking at them,
and then they say, time to get.

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:17.096
Aggressive, get out.

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:20.032
But they're trying to boxes and we're
going to make contact with blocks.

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:23.102
And then the driver, Charles
XM, appears to jerk the steering wheel

00:08:23.102 --> 00:08:26.439
to a left in the direction of Martinez's
vehicle, at which point the video jolts.

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:27.373
And then this happens.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.742
All right, out of the advice.

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:30.309
We've been struck.

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:32.778
We've been struck. You know.

00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:35.548
Whether that's XM firing those five shots
at Martinez's vehicle

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:38.818
and after she floors it out of there,
you can hear bystanders screaming at them.

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:43.222
But with one agent explaining to another
agent on the scene a few minutes later.

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:45.057
Vehicle struck us twice.

00:08:45.057 --> 00:08:47.693
Then when we stepped out to Florida
and tried to run them.

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:49.729
Over, and then later in the afternoon,
while Martinez

00:08:49.729 --> 00:08:51.631
was in the hospital
being treated for several gunshot

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:55.568
wounds, then Border Patrol Commander
Greg Bovino sent XLM an email reading,

00:08:55.568 --> 00:08:59.672
I would like to extend an offer to you
to extend your retirement beyond age 57.

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:02.942
In light of your excellent service
in Chicago, you have much left to do.

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:05.077
Meanwhile, you would xom texting
a group chat with his fellow

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:07.980
agents, labeled the posse chat,
where they heap praise on him

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.450
for his supposed heroism, one writing
you are a legend among agents.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.152
You better fucking know that beer's on me

00:09:13.152 --> 00:09:15.788
when I see you at training
as well as another adding that's awesome.

00:09:15.788 --> 00:09:17.957
You did real good with a heart eyes
emoji though.

00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:19.692
Also, I'll say it's not clear
whether they knew

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:20.493
what had really happened

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:23.195
because XOM said that he fired
through Martinez's front windshield,

00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:25.231
not the back
passenger window as she claimed. Right.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:27.166
Which is important because,
you know, one would seem to suggest

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:28.868
that he was in front of it
as it came at him,

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:31.404
while the other suggests
he was backing off to the side.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:31.904
Also with us.

00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:34.106
You had him sharing a link
to a news story headline,

00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:36.309
but our agents taunted Chicago woman
to do something

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:39.345
before shooting her attorney claims
and then captioning that lmao.

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:40.913
Then in another message, someone asked me

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:43.516
if the bosses have been supportive
and he replied big time.

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:46.552
Everyone has been including Chief Bovino,
Chief Banks, Secretary

00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:49.789
Nome and LFA himself,
according to Bovino or without heavy there

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:52.825
translating to the boss, which many have
interpreted as meaning Donald Trump.

00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:54.694
And then of course,
there's the disgusting text message

00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:58.397
we saw last week where XOM wrote, I fired
five shots and she had seven holes.

00:09:58.397 --> 00:09:59.599
Put that in your book, boys.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:02.301
And you know, for some added context,
this guy's not some fresh hire.

00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:04.303
He's a 23 year old veteran of the Border
Patrol.

00:10:04.303 --> 00:10:06.572
And so, you know, you start to think,
you know, what else is this guy done

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:08.074
throughout his career
that we don't know about?

00:10:08.074 --> 00:10:09.976
And also for now, he hasn't been charged.

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:13.479
In fact, Trump's DHS still maintains
that Martinez is a domestic terrorist,

00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:15.548
even though the charges against her
were dropped months ago.

00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:16.382
Of course, this is happening

00:10:16.382 --> 00:10:19.652
as the agents who shot Renee Goode
and Alex Brady are also still free men.

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:21.354
Though
there have been some people arrested,

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:24.757
we've now got an Associated Press review
out there, finding at least two dozen Ice

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:26.892
employees and contractors
who have been charged with crimes

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:29.028
since 2020,
and these are stories that are just crazy.

00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:31.163
You've got a detention facility
official admitting that he grabbed

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:34.233
a handcuffed detainee by the neck
and slammed him into a wall last year.

00:10:34.233 --> 00:10:35.901
There's also another facility official
admitted

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:38.204
to sexually abusing a detainee
for five months last year,

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:40.373
while telling other detainees
to act as lookouts.

00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:43.643
An assistant field office supervisor
allegedly abused his girlfriend for years,

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:45.778
fracturing her
hip and nose, causing internal bleeding

00:10:45.778 --> 00:10:47.580
and attempting to strangle her,
with the judge

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.715
calling him a volatile
and violent individual.

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:51.117
Then another Ice agent was found by local

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:54.220
police, passed out in a crash car
with his agency firearm on him,

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.422
and yet another Ice employee
went to meet someone he thought

00:10:56.422 --> 00:10:58.891
was a 17 year old prostitute,
and then discovered it was a sting.

00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:00.993
And he told the cops, I'm ice boys.

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:03.329
You also had a third agent
being pulled over for driving drunk

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.464
with his two kids in the car,
and then he demanded to know

00:11:05.464 --> 00:11:07.400
whether one of the deputies
arresting him was Haitian,

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.568
and he threatened, I'll run him
once I get out of here.

00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:12.271
And if he's not legit, ooh, he's
taking a ride back to Haiti.

00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:13.372
And then lastly, at least

00:11:13.372 --> 00:11:16.442
right here, a deportation officer
allegedly took cash bribes from bail

00:11:16.442 --> 00:11:18.511
bondsman
in exchange for removing Ice detainers

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:21.180
that Ice had placed on their clients,
targeting them for deportation.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.982
In many of these,
they happened over the past year.

00:11:22.982 --> 00:11:25.284
Others go further back,
but you have experts warning that

00:11:25.284 --> 00:11:28.054
this kind of shit, it's likely
just going to get worse and worse,

00:11:28.054 --> 00:11:30.856
arguing that by weakening oversight,
shortening training,

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:33.225
doubling its workforce,
making its culture more aggressive,

00:11:33.225 --> 00:11:36.395
and arguing that agents have absolute
immunity for their actions on

00:11:36.395 --> 00:11:39.632
duty, the Trump regime, they've just left
the door wide open for abuse.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.333
You know, with all this,
you had at least one group,

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:42.568
the Jewish Democratic Council

00:11:42.568 --> 00:11:45.938
of America, trying to appeal directly
to Donald Trump to end this madness,

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:47.540
because you had them saying
that they wanted to air

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.508
a segment
during one of Fox and Friends ad break,

00:11:49.508 --> 00:11:51.644
since the president is known to watch it
from the Oval Office.

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:54.480
You know, it starts with a voice over
saying, federal agents are executing

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.115
and terrorizing American citizens,

00:11:56.115 --> 00:11:58.584
detaining and tear gassing
children, creating chaos.

00:11:58.584 --> 00:11:59.952
And then it cuts to Joe Rogan.

00:11:59.952 --> 00:12:01.821
Are we really going to be the Gestapo?

00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:04.323
Where's your papers?
Is that what we've come to?

00:12:04.323 --> 00:12:07.860
And then the voiceover returns saying
ice are out of control when the government

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.763
kills Americans and lies about the victims
to cover up the crime.

00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:12.932
It's not law and order
and it's not leadership.

00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:14.633
Those responsible must be fired.

00:12:14.633 --> 00:12:16.202
President Trump, stop the abuse.

00:12:16.202 --> 00:12:18.204
Investigate
the killings. It's gone too far.

00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:19.505
And while CNN and MSNBC

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.607
are running
those ads this week, reportedly,

00:12:21.607 --> 00:12:24.376
Fox refused, offering no explanation
to the group as to why.

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:27.513
And so with that, you've got Trump
just going even deeper into his echo

00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:30.583
chamber of Fox and Friends Truth Social,
I slop and whatever

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.418
the fuck Stephen
Miller is whispering in his ear.

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:34.353
And then there's more
we've got to dive into in just a minute.

00:12:34.353 --> 00:12:36.288
But first,
let me thank a sponsor and say, you know,

00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:37.022
have you ever hired

00:12:37.022 --> 00:12:39.191
someone who looked great on paper
and then immediately

00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:41.827
just reminded you of that Doctor
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde scenario?

00:12:41.827 --> 00:12:45.264
Because hiring is basically like dating,
except that the stakes, it feels higher.

00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:47.333
Red flags,
they're quieter in the group chat.

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:49.135
It judges
your heart gets the right questions early

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:51.804
so you don't waste weeks
realizing, oh, no, this was a mistake.

00:12:51.804 --> 00:12:54.840
That's exactly why today's sponsor,
ZipRecruiter, is clutch when hiring right

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.711
now, you can try it for free
at ziprecruiter.com/defranco ZipRecruiter

00:12:58.711 --> 00:13:00.379
actually recommend
smart screening questions.

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:01.814
Do weed out bad fits bad.

00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:04.984
Instead of reading 400 resumes
fueled by regret, their magic technology

00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:08.554
doesn't just dump applicants on it
actively finds people who take your boxes.

00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:10.723
You can even filter for candidates
who are recently active,

00:13:10.723 --> 00:13:13.092
meaning that they're not just open to work
emotionally.

00:13:13.092 --> 00:13:15.361
ZipRecruiter
is the number one rated hiring site on G2,

00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:17.630
which is like yo,
but we're not ruining your company.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.399
And bottom line, better
questions lead to better hires and fewer.

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:21.634
How did this happen? Meetings.

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.569
Ask questions and hire faster.

00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:25.938

Meet your match on ZipRecruiter.

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:38.184
But then diving back into the news,
we better talk about how the Trump

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:40.019
administration
just moved to shut down the skies

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:43.556
over a major American city for ten days
with zero warning, zero explanation,

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:45.391
and then appeared to lie
about why it happened.

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:46.892
You know, it
all unraveled in just a few hours.

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:49.261
So let's talk
about what happened with El Paso, Texas,

00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:51.864
because late last night,
you or the FAA dropping a bombshell,

00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:54.834
they issued a temporary flight restriction
over El Paso, Texas.

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.403
So for the next ten days,
everything up to 18,000ft.

00:13:57.403 --> 00:14:00.806
And within a ten nautical mile
radius was off limits to all pilots,

00:14:00.806 --> 00:14:03.843
excluding Mexican airspace and
the accompanying notice to air missions.

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.211
It did not mince words.

00:14:05.211 --> 00:14:08.514
It warned pilots pilots who do not adhere
to the following procedure may be

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:12.218
intercepted, detained at, interviewed
by law enforcement security personnel.

00:14:12.218 --> 00:14:14.787
It's a violators could face
civil penalties or criminal charges.

00:14:14.787 --> 00:14:15.588
And then came the kicker.

00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:17.790
They said the United States government
may use deadly force

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.992
against the airborne aircraft
if it is determined

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:22.428
that the aircraft poses
an imminent security threat.

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:25.130
So naturally, people wanted to know, okay,
what the hell is going on?

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:28.234
And then the FAA's answer
was just special security reasons.

00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:28.601
That's it.

00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:29.401
No other details.

00:14:29.401 --> 00:14:32.137
Now, they also issued a second restriction
for Santa Teresa, New Mexico,

00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:35.174
which is a small community about 15 miles
northwest of El Paso Airport.

00:14:35.174 --> 00:14:37.309
But the focus it stayed on El Paso
because,

00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:38.611
you know, it's not just some small town

00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:41.113
talking about the 23rd
most populous city in America

00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:42.648
with roughly 700,000 residents.

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:44.783
And I didn't see you,
Laura has just over the border.

00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:48.020
I mean, you're looking at a metropolitan
area of over 2 million people, El Paso's

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.656
airport alone at nearly 3.5
million passengers last year.

00:14:50.656 --> 00:14:51.824
So when the airport posted on Instagram

00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:54.026
that all commercial cargo
and general aviation

00:14:54.026 --> 00:14:55.961
flights were shut down through February
20th,

00:14:55.961 --> 00:14:58.197
you had people understandably confused
and pissed off, right?

00:14:58.197 --> 00:15:01.367
You know, to be fair though, the FAA does
issue temporary flight restrictions

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:04.737
all the time for wildfires, hurricanes,
the Super Bowl, stuff like that.

00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:06.538
But shutting down
airspace over a major U.S.

00:15:06.538 --> 00:15:09.441
city for ten days with no explanation.
That's highly unusual.

00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:11.810
Apparently, it's also pretty uncommon
for these notices to go out

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.213
without carve outs for first responders
and military aircraft.

00:15:14.213 --> 00:15:16.715
So with all this, you don't CNN
correspondent covering aviation,

00:15:16.715 --> 00:15:19.318
putting it bluntly this morning,
saying a ban on all flights over a U.S.

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:22.688
city, including medevac and police
helicopters has no modern precedent.

00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:25.724
Even the post 911 restrictions
and the ongoing ones over D.C.

00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:27.092
in New York were handled differently.

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:29.561
Also, Congresswoman Veronica Escobar,
whose district includes

00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:32.364
El Paso, released a statement
saying the highly consequential decision

00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:34.600
by the FAA
to shut down the El Paso airport

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.103
for ten days is unprecedented and resulted
in significant concern in the community.

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:41.240
They're also adding that based on what
her office gathered, there is no immediate

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.841
threat to the community
or surrounding areas

00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:45.477
and that there was no advance
notice provided to my office,

00:15:45.477 --> 00:15:48.347
the City of El Paso,
or anyone involved in airport operations.

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:50.883
And so she urged the FAA to immediately
lift the restrictions.

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:51.850
And actually, guess what?

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:55.087
Shortly after they do exactly
that, the FAA announcing of the temporary

00:15:55.087 --> 00:15:58.223
closure was lifted, saying
there is no threat to commercial aviation.

00:15:58.223 --> 00:15:59.858
All flights will resume as normal.

00:15:59.858 --> 00:16:02.661
But then around the same time,
you had an unnamed Trump administration

00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:04.563
official telling reporters
that the shutdown happened

00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:07.032
because Mexican cartel drones
had breached the airspace.

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:09.435
But the military, they dealt with it
and everything was safe.

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:10.970
Now, you actually had Transportation
Secretary

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.973
Sean Duffy quickly echoing that
version of events on social media,

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:17.676
saying the FAA and DoD acted swiftly
to address a cartel drone incursion.

00:16:17.676 --> 00:16:19.945
The threat has been neutralized
and there is no danger

00:16:19.945 --> 00:16:21.213
to commercial travel in the region.

00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:23.816
Restrictions have been lifted
and normal flights are resuming.

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:27.486
You know, interesting story, except
it started to unravel almost immediately.

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:30.189
The Congresswoman Escobar coming out
and saying that cartel drones being

00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:32.658
the reason is not the information
that Congress has been given.

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:34.760
She also pointed out
that there have been drone incursions

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.294
from Mexico

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:38.430
going back to as long as drones
existed, saying, so this is nothing new.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.098
You know, she's right.

00:16:39.098 --> 00:16:41.200
Back in July, in fact,
the deputy director of the Homeland

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.837
Security Department's Counter drone
program told Congress that 27,000 drones

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:47.873
piloted by organizations hostile
to law enforcement have flown within

00:16:47.873 --> 00:16:51.944
500m of the border over
just six months in 2024, 27,000.

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:54.446
So if cartel drones were really the issue,
why now?

00:16:54.446 --> 00:16:56.648
Why this specific response
and why you see sources?

00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:58.650
They started telling
a very different story

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.753
with the New York Times
reporting that the shutdown had something

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:03.022
to do with a test of new counter
drone technology

00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:04.656
by the military at a nearby army base.

00:17:04.656 --> 00:17:06.392
And another person briefed by Trump
officials back

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:09.094
this up, saying that the FAA's decision
was prompted by concerns

00:17:09.094 --> 00:17:12.331
about the risks that this technology
could pose to other aircraft in the area.

00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:15.334
And then other outlets just continued
to confirm this account and then add to it

00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:16.735
some reporting
that the weapon being tested

00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:18.971
was a high energy laser,
and that because the Pentagon

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:21.106
wanted to test it
before the FAA was on board,

00:17:21.106 --> 00:17:24.643
the agency's administrator, Brian Bedford,
decided to just close the airspace

00:17:24.643 --> 00:17:27.813
without alerting white House, Pentagon
or Homeland Security officials.

00:17:27.846 --> 00:17:30.716
And this is there have also been reports
that what this anti-drone technology

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:33.852
actually ended up being used against
may have been a party balloon

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:35.721
that had just been mistaken for a drone.

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:38.490
So just to recap,
the official story is cartel drones.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.326
We stopped them all good,
but the actual story appears to be that

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:43.328
the military wanted to test
Anti-drone weapons

00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:45.064
and they didn't properly coordinate
with anyone.

00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:48.167
And so the FAA panicked, shut down
the entire city's airspace.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.869
So, you know, as far as the fallout,
you've got local officials furious.

00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:54.173
El Paso Mayor Renard Johnson
not holding back at a news conference.

00:17:54.173 --> 00:17:58.477
I want to be very, very clear
that this should have never happened.

00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:02.014
You cannot restrict

00:18:02.014 --> 00:18:04.883
airspace over a major city

00:18:04.883 --> 00:18:07.653
without coordinating with the city,

00:18:07.653 --> 00:18:12.091
the airport,
the hospitals, the community leadership.

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:16.895
That failure
to communicate is unacceptable.

00:18:16.895 --> 00:18:18.330
You know, this wasn't
just an inconvenience.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.898
The mayor noted that surgical equipment

00:18:19.898 --> 00:18:22.000
destined for city hospitals
just didn't show up.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.168
With medical evacuation flights

00:18:23.168 --> 00:18:26.105
forced to divert to a city of New Mexico,
more than 40 miles away.

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:28.273
And I mean, this is just from a few hours
a shut down.

00:18:28.273 --> 00:18:30.609
Imagine
if this had gone on for ten days. Now.

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:32.311
With all of that
said, I do think it's important

00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:33.946
that we talk about
some of the bigger context here.

00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:37.216
The military isn't testing anti-drone
tech at the border for no reason.

00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:39.518
Going back a decade, one of Mexico's
major cartels started

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:42.554
systematically using drones
for surveillance, combat and transport.

00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:44.756
Today, officials have documented
cartel conflicts

00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:48.460
where drones are being used to carry and
deploy up to 50kg of explosives at once.

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:50.596
U.S. officials are concerned
that they might eventually target

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:53.265
Americans or law enforcement in the border
region, though so far

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:55.067
it appears that the thousands of drones
spotted near

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:57.503
the US, they've been used for drug
smuggling and surveillance.

00:18:57.503 --> 00:18:58.170
Not a tax yet.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:02.040
But also, I'll say here is an ironic twist
when it comes to cartel violence.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.109
A lot of the weapons
come from the United States.

00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:06.211
And in fact, this week, Mexico's
defense secretary revealed

00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:09.481
that roughly half of the high powered
50 caliber cartridges seized from cartel

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:13.018
since 2012 can be traced back
to an ammunition factory in Missouri.

00:19:13.018 --> 00:19:15.787
One that's also owned by the US
government is an investigation

00:19:15.787 --> 00:19:18.190
by the International Consortium
of Investigative Journalists,

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.358
and the New York Times found that

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:22.494
the ammo from that plant
has become a staple for organized crime

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:25.764
in Mexico, and has even been used
by mass shooters in the United States.

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:28.734
The Army has defended this by saying
that commercial sales from the plant,

00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:31.770
they save taxpayers around $50 million
annually by lowering

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.138
the government's cost for ammunition.

00:19:33.138 --> 00:19:35.641
But also it's not just ammunition,
but you also had Mexico's

00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:38.043
defense secretary
saying nearly 80% of weapons seized

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:40.646
by the current administration
came from the United States.

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:43.215
The Mexican government
actually sued major American gun makers,

00:19:43.215 --> 00:19:45.984
alleging that their business practices
fueled violence in Mexico.

00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:47.519
Though
the Supreme Court threw that case out.

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:50.722
But all of this, it brings us back to
why this story in this situation matters.

00:19:50.722 --> 00:19:51.990
It reveals a dangerous pattern.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.693
You've got a government taking extreme
action with no transparency,

00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:57.763
no coordination with local officials,
and then lying about why it happened.

00:19:57.763 --> 00:20:00.933
A major American city had its airspace
shut down, affecting hospitals,

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:03.135
emergency services
and hundreds of thousands of people

00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:06.038
because federal agencies couldn't
be bothered to communicate properly.

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:06.638
Then when caught,

00:20:06.638 --> 00:20:08.774
they just blamed cartel drones
instead of admitting

00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:11.610
that it was one of their own weapons tests
that caused the chaos.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:14.246
And then there's even more
we've got to dive into in just a minute.

00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:17.849
But first, let me thank a sponsor and say,
you know, Lina, and if your phone bill,

00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:20.552
it makes you sigh loudly every month
because this is for you.

00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:22.654
Today's sponsor,
Mint Mobile, makes so much sense.

00:20:22.654 --> 00:20:25.724
They've rebuilt wireless
to be simpler online and more reasonable.

00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:28.093
No stores, no sales counters,
no awkward upsells.

00:20:28.093 --> 00:20:29.494
You sign up online and you done.

00:20:29.494 --> 00:20:32.130

to up to 20GB and unlimited plans,
which is a must when working remotely.

00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:49.114
One of the things I love
is the flexibility, right?

00:20:49.114 --> 00:20:53.218
You can pick the data that fits your life
five gigabytes, 15GB, 20GB are unlimited.

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:56.688
So switching fast activated minutes

Simple.

00:20:57.155 --> 00:20:59.458
And honestly,

00:21:13.005 --> 00:21:16.675
That's Mint mobile.com/defranco
or scan that QR code.

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:20.112
But then diving right back into the news,
the FBI thought they had their guy

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:21.513
in the Nancy Guthrie kidnaping case.

00:21:21.513 --> 00:21:24.316
They raided his house,
they detained him the whole nine yards.

00:21:24.316 --> 00:21:25.183
There's just one problem.

00:21:25.183 --> 00:21:27.686
He says he has no idea
who Nancy Guthrie even is.

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:29.921
And now this case
just got a whole lot messier.

00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:31.990
So here's what went down yesterday,
the Pima County Sheriff's

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.359
Office detained a suspect
during a traffic stop south of Tucson.

00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:34.893
Any question?

00:21:34.893 --> 00:21:36.762
This guy
about the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie,

00:21:36.762 --> 00:21:38.630
the mother of today
show host Savannah Guthrie,

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.200
who vanished from her home over a week ago
shortly after the FBI launching a search

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.368
at his home in Rio Rico,

00:21:43.368 --> 00:21:46.405
Arizona, about an hour south of Tucson,
right near the Mexican border.

00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:49.474
The timing it seemed very significant
because all of this happened just hours

00:21:49.474 --> 00:21:50.342
after the FBI released

00:21:50.342 --> 00:21:53.578
photos and videos of a potential suspect
caught on camera at Nancy's door

00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:55.380
the night that she disappeared,
wearing a ski mask.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:56.148
And the footage reportedly

00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:59.184
generated a massive spike in Tucson,
so people were genuinely hopeful

00:21:59.184 --> 00:22:00.986
that this could be the break
that investigators needed.

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:02.421
Then things started to unravel.

00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:04.690
The homeowner,
the suspect's mother in law, came out

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.025
and told reporters that her son in law
had nothing to do with this,

00:22:07.025 --> 00:22:09.227
and he's just a delivery driver
doing his job.

00:22:09.227 --> 00:22:11.129
And she flat out said, no, that's not him.

00:22:11.129 --> 00:22:12.864
No, I can assure you, that's not him.

00:22:12.864 --> 00:22:15.000
And then it was confirmed
that the guy got released.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.669
And as far as his side of things,
his name is reportedly Carlos.

00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:20.439
And he gave an interview to Telemundo
where he explained that, yes,

00:22:20.439 --> 00:22:22.507
the FBI searched his house
with a warrant, damaging

00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:24.276
both his front
and back doors in the process.

00:22:24.276 --> 00:22:25.010
He also said that

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.579
agents told him that he resembled
the person in the footage of the FBI

00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:29.781
release, though he completely disagreed
with that assessment.

00:22:29.781 --> 00:22:32.150
Regardless, insisting that he has nothing
to do with Nancy's disappearance.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:33.452
He doesn't watch the Today show.

00:22:33.452 --> 00:22:34.953
He doesn't know who Savannah Guthrie is,

00:22:34.953 --> 00:22:37.089
and he had no clue
her mom was even missing.

00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:39.624
When they finally told you
this was had to do with some kidnaping.

00:22:39.624 --> 00:22:41.226
Like what? What were you. Thinking?

00:22:41.226 --> 00:22:43.662
What the heck am I doing here? Know
I didn't do anything.

00:22:43.662 --> 00:22:45.263
John is. No, I'm innocent.

00:22:45.263 --> 00:22:47.432
I mean, I hope they get the suspect,
so I'm not.

00:22:47.432 --> 00:22:49.701
It any better. Do their job
and find the suspect.

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:50.669
They did it so they can clear.

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:52.738
My name
written. Carlos also said he has no idea

00:22:52.738 --> 00:22:54.573
why the authorities
were even interested in him.

00:22:54.573 --> 00:22:57.743
They gave him no details about
whether it was his car, his license plate,

00:22:57.743 --> 00:22:59.211
or what triggered the investigation.

00:22:59.211 --> 00:23:02.381
Also, he said technically law enforcement
didn't pull him over and said saying that

00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:04.850
he noticed them following him
and pulled over himself. Right.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.753
Also claiming that it took hours
before his rights were even read to him.

00:23:07.753 --> 00:23:10.422
And he said that he does
deliver packages in Tucson for work.

00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:12.791
He can't recall if he's ever
made a delivery to Nancy's home.

00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:14.726
But for their part, as of this morning,
you had county officials

00:23:14.726 --> 00:23:17.596
saying that he was questioned as, quote,
part of follow up on incoming leads.

00:23:17.596 --> 00:23:19.598
You know, naturally,
this whole situation has sparked

00:23:19.598 --> 00:23:22.134
a lot of criticism
of how the FBI's been handling things.

00:23:22.134 --> 00:23:23.001
Senator Chris Murphy,

00:23:23.001 --> 00:23:26.738
seeing Carlos, his interview and tweeting
the FBI, now run by online influencers,

00:23:26.738 --> 00:23:30.142
hair tonic salesman and talk show host,
has become a shell of its former self.

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:33.044
The next president is going to have
an enormous job to rebuild it.

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:34.880
But then last night, you had FBI Director
Kash Patel

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.150
pushing back on Fox News, suggesting
that they were actually making progress.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.285
I will say
we have made substantial progress

00:23:40.285 --> 00:23:41.753
in these last 36, 48 hours,

00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:44.623
thanks to the technical capabilities,
the FBI and our partnerships.

00:23:44.623 --> 00:23:49.761
And I do believe we are looking at people
who, as we say, are persons of interest.

00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:52.397
And today we learned from the FBI
that there's a search in the Catalina

00:23:52.397 --> 00:23:54.399
Foothills area related to Nancy Guthrie,
though

00:23:54.399 --> 00:23:57.035
we have no other information on that.
But then it gets weirder, right?

00:23:57.035 --> 00:23:57.869
Because this morning,

00:23:57.869 --> 00:23:59.971
TMZ reported that they received a note
from someone claiming

00:23:59.971 --> 00:24:03.108
to have information about the Kidnaper
in exchange for one Bitcoin.

00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:05.944
Now, TMZ, they emphasized here
that the legitimacy is unclear,

00:24:05.944 --> 00:24:08.246
especially since multiple media outlets
have already received

00:24:08.246 --> 00:24:10.615
alleged and unverified ransom notes
throughout the case.

00:24:10.615 --> 00:24:12.517
But this sender claims
that they've unsuccessfully

00:24:12.517 --> 00:24:14.619
tried to reach Savannah
and her family. Right?

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:14.986
If they want

00:24:14.986 --> 00:24:18.323
the name of the individual involved,
then I want one Bitcoin to the following

00:24:18.323 --> 00:24:22.093
wallet time is more than relevant and
so now we're waiting to see what happens.

00:24:22.093 --> 00:24:23.829
Also,
if any other outlets get similar notes

00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:25.263
and whether any of this is legitimate.

00:24:25.263 --> 00:24:26.198
Now, you know, with all this,

00:24:26.198 --> 00:24:28.733
if people really focused on this situation
for three reasons.

00:24:28.733 --> 00:24:31.470
One, of course, a woman is still missing
and every day that passes,

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.338
it makes finding her safely
even more difficult.

00:24:33.338 --> 00:24:34.739
Two this botched attention.

00:24:34.739 --> 00:24:37.909
It raises serious questions about
investigative procedures with Trump's FBI.

00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:38.109
Right now,

00:24:38.109 --> 00:24:39.778
someone gets their house
raided and detained

00:24:39.778 --> 00:24:42.047
for hours, only to be released
with no clear explanation

00:24:42.047 --> 00:24:43.648
of why
they were targeted in the first place.

00:24:43.648 --> 00:24:46.351
And also now three the emergence
of potential ransom notes, right?

00:24:46.351 --> 00:24:49.020
Real or fake,
it complicates an already tense situation

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.922
and it could interfere
with the actual investigation.

00:24:50.922 --> 00:24:52.357
But then next up from that,

00:24:52.357 --> 00:24:54.659
there's actually two big final things
I want to hit on today.

00:24:54.659 --> 00:24:56.661
Right in the first of the two
is that we need to talk about how a Trump

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:58.964
appointed federal judge
just delivered a massive blow

00:24:58.964 --> 00:25:01.132
to one of Trump's
most aggressive power grabs yet.

00:25:01.132 --> 00:25:02.834
And one,
this is the third time that the courts

00:25:02.834 --> 00:25:04.803
have actually told the administration
to back the hell off.

00:25:04.803 --> 00:25:05.337
And two,

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:07.205
this is about
way more than just voter rolls,

00:25:07.205 --> 00:25:08.206
because last summer, the Trump

00:25:08.206 --> 00:25:11.243
DOJ began demanding that every state
turn over complete voter rolls.

00:25:11.243 --> 00:25:13.111
And we're not talking about
just basic information here.

00:25:13.111 --> 00:25:16.748
We're talking driver's license numbers,
Social Security numbers, email addresses,

00:25:16.748 --> 00:25:19.951
phone numbers, party registrations,
and full voter participation histories.

00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:22.120
And the Trump administration
claimed that this was all part of a plan

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.656
to centralize election data
in a national voting database.

00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:26.625
You know, that sounds reasonable
enough on the surface.

00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:28.727
Except here is the part
they didn't advertise.

00:25:28.727 --> 00:25:30.962
According to a draft agreement
obtained by the Brennan Center,

00:25:30.962 --> 00:25:34.466
the DOJ specifically said that it would
conduct its own analysis of states

00:25:34.499 --> 00:25:38.169
voter files and then order the states
to remove specific voters from the rolls.

00:25:38.169 --> 00:25:40.972
And to be very clear
here, that has never happened before.

00:25:40.972 --> 00:25:42.407
States, not the federal government,

00:25:42.407 --> 00:25:44.709
have the legal authority
to add and remove voters.

00:25:44.709 --> 00:25:46.745
That is how it has always worked,
and for good reason.

00:25:46.745 --> 00:25:48.947
You have many experts now raising
serious concerns that the Trump

00:25:48.947 --> 00:25:51.950
administration is trying to improperly
purge valid voters from the rolls

00:25:52.017 --> 00:25:54.920
to suppress Democratic votes and boost
Republican chances in the election.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.122
And that becomes even more concerning,
given that around 11

00:25:57.122 --> 00:25:59.357
states have already complied
or said that they will comply

00:25:59.357 --> 00:26:02.060
with these requests to hand over
incredibly sensitive voter information.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.630
But I'll also say that the majority
of states, both Democratic and Republican,

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.233
have refused to have the Trump DOJ
doing what you would expect.

00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:11.102
They sued over 20 states,
most of which have Democratic governors,

00:26:11.102 --> 00:26:12.871
to try and force them
to hand over the data.

00:26:12.871 --> 00:26:14.673
So in the lawsuit against Michigan,
you get the Trump

00:26:14.673 --> 00:26:16.241
DOJ arguing that it was entitled

00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:16.575
to know

00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:18.577
the personal information
of Michigan voters to, quote,

00:26:18.577 --> 00:26:22.213
prevent the inclusion of ineligible voters
and combat what it called voter fraud.

00:26:22.213 --> 00:26:23.949
But then yesterday,
a federal judge in Michigan

00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:25.650
who was actually appointed
by Donald Trump,

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.586
rejected those claims
and dismissed the case.

00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:29.821
You're the judge ruling
that there was no basis to seize

00:26:29.821 --> 00:26:32.791
these records under the federal laws
that the DOJ used to justify its request.

00:26:32.791 --> 00:26:35.694
And the fact that this happened in
Michigan is also especially notable

00:26:35.694 --> 00:26:38.029
in Michigan is one of Trump's
top targets in his efforts

00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:39.631
to overturn the 2020 election.

00:26:39.631 --> 00:26:41.766
And he's made it clear
that the state is on his radar again

00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:42.734
for the upcoming midterms.

00:26:42.734 --> 00:26:44.102
But he's continually spread false claims

00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:45.170
about voter fraud in Michigan,

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.106
even though he literally won
the state himself in 2024.

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:50.442
And in fact, more recently,
he specifically called out Detroit

00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:52.544
while talking about
nationalizing elections, claiming

00:26:52.544 --> 00:26:55.046
without any evidence
that there are high levels of fraud there.

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:57.082
But also, one of the things
that's very significant here is that

00:26:57.082 --> 00:27:00.719
Michigan is now the third federal court
to shut down the DOJ's voter data grab,

00:27:00.719 --> 00:27:02.821
which just last week,
a federal judge in Oregon ruled

00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:04.789
against the DOJ,
saying that he didn't trust the Trump

00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:06.858
administration
to keep the sensitive data private.

00:27:06.858 --> 00:27:08.660
He also just didn't believe
the administration's claims

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.595
that it would only use the voter rolls
for election

00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:12.764
administration, raising concerns
that it would weaponize

00:27:12.764 --> 00:27:14.399
the information
for immigration enforcement.

00:27:14.399 --> 00:27:14.899
And then actually,

00:27:14.899 --> 00:27:18.003
before that, another federal judge blocked
the DOJ's efforts in California.

00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:20.639
Last month, ruling
that the request was an unprecedented

00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:22.941
and illegal power
grab meant to disenfranchize voters.

00:27:22.941 --> 00:27:23.508
You're the judge.

00:27:23.508 --> 00:27:26.411
Writing the foundation upon
which American democracy has been built

00:27:26.411 --> 00:27:27.479
is the right to vote.

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:28.780
Now, it seems the executive branch

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.749
of the United States
government wants to abridge

00:27:30.749 --> 00:27:32.817
the right of many Americans
to cast their ballots.

00:27:32.817 --> 00:27:33.451
And, you know, the fact that

00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:37.122
a third judge, and no less a Trump
appointee, has now ruled the same way.

00:27:37.222 --> 00:27:38.723
It shows this isn't a Partizan issue

00:27:38.723 --> 00:27:41.760
multiple and politically diverse
federal courts are saying the same thing.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:42.961
This is a legal overreach.

00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:45.797
And of course, all the while there are
still many other fronts in this battle.

00:27:45.797 --> 00:27:48.266
Right on top of all the other states
that the DOJ has sued for refusing

00:27:48.266 --> 00:27:50.268
to turn over voter
data, it's very possible

00:27:50.268 --> 00:27:52.337
that they're going to appeal
these three decisions. And,

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:54.572
of course, you know, the administration's
not just relying on lawsuits.

00:27:54.572 --> 00:27:57.676
We've also had Attorney General Pam Bondi
weaponizing other branches

00:27:57.676 --> 00:27:59.544
of the government
to coerce states into compliance.

00:27:59.544 --> 00:28:02.580
We just last month, amid the Minnesota
ice takeover, Bondi sent Governor Tim

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.950
Walz a letter demanding that he turn over
voter data if he wanted to restore

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:09.020
order in his state, a move that,
of course, drew widespread backlash.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.355
And some experts described the letter

00:28:10.355 --> 00:28:12.691
as a ransom note and others
calling it blackmail.

00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:14.559
And so ultimately, this is something
we're gonna have to keep an eye on

00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:17.696
because it is a fundamental attack
on how American elections work.

00:28:17.729 --> 00:28:19.197
And the federal government
has never had the power

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:21.332
to unilaterally remove voters
from state roles.

00:28:21.332 --> 00:28:23.735
And for good reason.
It is a system that is ripe for abuse.

00:28:23.735 --> 00:28:27.405
If the DOJ, whether it be Trump's DOJ
or someone else, is DOJ, and for states

00:28:27.405 --> 00:28:30.442
to hand over sensitive personal data
and then decide who gets purged,

00:28:30.508 --> 00:28:33.144
that's not protecting election integrity,
that is undermining it.

00:28:33.144 --> 00:28:34.612
But then with all of that said,

00:28:34.612 --> 00:28:36.715
it brings us to the final thing
that we should talk about today.

00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:38.650
And that is YouTube's
lawyers just stood up in court

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:41.252
and said with a straight face,
we're not social media.

00:28:41.252 --> 00:28:42.220
Whether you buy that or not,

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.723
this trial could completely reshape
the internet as we know it.

00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:46.891
And because tech
giants billions of dollars

00:28:46.891 --> 00:28:49.160
because we're watching the kickoff
of a massive landmark

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.897
trial centered around a now 20 year
old woman identified by her initials, KDM,

00:28:52.897 --> 00:28:55.633
who's accusing meta and YouTube
of building addictive platforms

00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:58.036
that hooked her at a very young age
and destroyed her mental health.

00:28:58.036 --> 00:29:00.271
It's also worth
noting that this suit originally includes

00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:03.308
snap and TikTok as well,
but they actually managed to avoid trial

00:29:03.308 --> 00:29:05.210
by reaching settlements
under undisclosed terms.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.579
So now we're left with meta
and YouTube in the hot seat.

00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:09.414
Now, as far as the specifics
of the lawsuit,

00:29:09.414 --> 00:29:12.450
it alleges that meta and YouTube
made calculated design choices

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:15.820
infinite scroll autoplay
algorithmic recommendations specifically

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.790
to make these apps more addictive
to kids and boost their own profits.

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:21.559
During the trial, Kagame's
lawyers did not pull punches going meta

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:24.629
and YouTube digital casinos
intentionally designed to get children

00:29:24.629 --> 00:29:25.396
and teens addicted.

00:29:25.396 --> 00:29:28.266
They claim that the platforms
of engineered addiction and children's

00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:31.336
brains, and argued that tech executives
knew the risks and said

00:29:31.369 --> 00:29:33.638
they didn't just build apps,
they built traps.

00:29:33.638 --> 00:29:35.740
They didn't want users,
they wanted addicts.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.876
It's a pretty damning language.
But here's what makes it interesting.

00:29:37.876 --> 00:29:39.644
Where's where the tech companies
are claiming the Kagame's

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:42.881
mental health issues were caused by her
difficult family life, not social media,

00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:45.150
and they're denying that their products
intentionally harm children,

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:47.152
pointing to safeguards
that they've enacted in recent years

00:29:47.152 --> 00:29:49.721
and arguing that there is no scientific
evidence proving it.

00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:50.789
Their apps cause addiction.

00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:53.725
We're also notably leaning on federal law,
claiming that it shields them

00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:55.927
from liability
for content posted on their platform.

00:29:55.927 --> 00:29:57.962
But also, maybe the wildest part YouTube's

00:29:57.962 --> 00:29:59.264
lawyers are trying to distance themselves

00:29:59.264 --> 00:30:02.367
from meta by arguing that YouTube isn't
even a form of social media,

00:30:02.367 --> 00:30:04.636
but they're claiming that YouTube
is actually an entertainment platform

00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:06.738
that more closely resembles
Netflix and Facebook.

00:30:06.738 --> 00:30:08.940
They say that it's different
because people use it for streaming

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.675
helpful videos,
not endless scrolling, right?

00:30:10.675 --> 00:30:13.611
No one will ever push back on claims
that YouTube's algorithm drives addiction

00:30:13.611 --> 00:30:15.313
by saying it's
not trying to get in your brain

00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:17.515
and rewire it, it's
just asking what you like to watch.

00:30:17.515 --> 00:30:20.285
But with that, you've had many pushing
back, saying that YouTube has comments,

00:30:20.285 --> 00:30:22.821
community post
subscriptions, notifications, an algorithm

00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.956
that absolutely keeps
you watching a short speech

00:30:24.956 --> 00:30:26.825
or that literally is designed
to compete with TikTok.

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:29.527
But also a big factor here is that
this isn't just a one off lawsuit, right?

00:30:29.527 --> 00:30:32.063
This is just the first to go out
to trial out of thousands

00:30:32.063 --> 00:30:34.499
of similar lawsuits
alleging that social media platforms

00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:37.101
deliberately addicted adolescents
and cause personal injury

00:30:37.101 --> 00:30:40.438
or other harms, and all four tech giants
meta, YouTube, snap and TikTok.

00:30:40.438 --> 00:30:43.441
They're named in various combinations
across those other cases, and actually,

00:30:43.441 --> 00:30:45.343
they're all relying on a novel legal claim

00:30:45.343 --> 00:30:48.346
that these apps can be as addictive
and as harmful as cigarets.

00:30:48.446 --> 00:30:50.682
These cases are specifically drawn
from the legal strategy

00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:53.084
used against Big Tobacco in the 1990s,
where

00:30:53.084 --> 00:30:54.752
plaintiffs argued that cigaret makers

00:30:54.752 --> 00:30:57.755
knew how harmful their products were,
but hid that information from the public.

00:30:57.755 --> 00:30:59.090
And that's strategy their IT work.

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:02.927
Those cases totally upended the tobacco
market, cigaret companies reached a $206

00:31:02.927 --> 00:31:06.631
billion master settlement and agreed
to stop marketing to minors, which paved

00:31:06.631 --> 00:31:09.634
the way for strict tobacco regulations
and a massive decline in smoking.

00:31:09.634 --> 00:31:12.070
And now, with GM suit
being the first to go to trial,

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.405
it's being seen as a massive test case
that could determine

00:31:14.405 --> 00:31:16.341
how thousands of other similar cases
play out.

00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:17.775
So if this case swings in her favor,

00:31:17.775 --> 00:31:20.812
it could trigger a cascading effect
similar to Big Tobacco, potentially

00:31:20.812 --> 00:31:23.381
putting tech firms on the hook
for billions of dollars in damages

00:31:23.381 --> 00:31:25.550
and forcing them to completely redesign
their platform.

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.285
I mean, we're talking
about potentially revolutionizing

00:31:27.285 --> 00:31:29.587
or destroying, depending on your point of
view, the entire industry.

00:31:29.587 --> 00:31:30.121
And all the while,

00:31:30.121 --> 00:31:31.689
there's a lot of debate
happening out there

00:31:31.689 --> 00:31:34.225
about whether social media
is actually as harmful as tobacco.

00:31:34.225 --> 00:31:37.262
But the science is still developing
and the comparisons, they're not perfect.

00:31:37.295 --> 00:31:38.997
What's not debatable
is that these platforms

00:31:38.997 --> 00:31:42.267
are designed to maximize engagement
and that engagement equals profit,

00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:44.068
whether that crosses the line
into deliberate harm,

00:31:44.068 --> 00:31:45.570
especially when it comes to children.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.538
That is exactly what this trial
is trying to determine.

00:31:47.538 --> 00:31:49.507
And YouTube's claim,
you know that it's not social media.

00:31:49.507 --> 00:31:51.409
It does feel more like a legal maneuver,

00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:53.544
more than reality,
where the platforms have evolved way

00:31:53.544 --> 00:31:55.780
beyond just posting videos,
that the algorithm doesn't

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.583
just ask what you like to watch it,
it learns your patterns.

00:31:58.583 --> 00:32:01.152
It serves you content based on
what keeps you engaged the longest.

00:32:01.152 --> 00:32:03.421
And use a psychological trigger
is to keep you coming back.

00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:04.622
But it seems like someone could
easily argue

00:32:04.622 --> 00:32:07.458
that's not passive entertainment,
that's active engagement optimization.

00:32:07.458 --> 00:32:09.427
You know, with all that,
this is the Philip DeFranco show.

00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:11.462
Yes, it's a new show,
but it's also a conversation.

00:32:11.462 --> 00:32:14.565
So in addition to you leaving thoughts,
comments, reactions to any of the news

00:32:14.565 --> 00:32:17.902
that stood out to you today for this news
specifically, do you think tech platforms

00:32:17.902 --> 00:32:19.871
are genuinely addictive
in a way that causes harm,

00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:22.874
or is this placing too much blame
on the companies or individuals

00:32:22.874 --> 00:32:23.574
and family issues?

00:32:23.574 --> 00:32:23.975
And also,

00:32:23.975 --> 00:32:25.009
do you agree with you buy

00:32:25.009 --> 00:32:27.211
YouTube's argument
that it is not social media,

00:32:27.211 --> 00:32:28.846
but that my friends,
you beautiful bastards,

00:32:28.846 --> 00:32:31.249
brings us to the end of your Wednesday
Philip DeFranco show.

00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:33.651
Another daily
dive into the news in the books.

00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:35.586
Well,
of course I want to say I love yo faces.

00:32:35.586 --> 00:32:37.655
And of course, I'll see you
right back here tomorrow.

00:32:37.655 --> 00:32:39.257
There's even more that you can watch
right now,

00:32:39.257 --> 00:32:40.591
but a brand new episode of my podcast

00:32:40.591 --> 00:32:44.162
Crashing Out just went out today
and it was a ride.

00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:45.930
Bad Bunny say he's gonna wear a dress.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:48.566
Bad Bunny is not going to sing in
English. He's a. Foreigner.

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:51.269
I love to be like,
I hope that I could age like you

00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:54.072
when it's very obvious
that they've had plastic surgery.

00:32:54.072 --> 00:32:55.306
She looked in the camera and said.

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:57.608
All the cool people are going. I'm like,
you should be banned from schools.

00:32:57.608 --> 00:32:59.978
You were involved or you knew
and you did nothing.

00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:03.281
We allow, abuse survivors
to get a rock and get a throw in.
