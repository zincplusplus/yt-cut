00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.001
can't afford to ignore this.

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.070
Donald Trump is now openly calling
for Republicans to steal power

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.940
from the states and, in his words,
take over the elections.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.809
But yesterday he called in to the Dan
Bongino show and he said.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.847
Look, I took over a border with 25 million
people came into our country,

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:17.017
many of them murderers,
if we don't get them out,

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:20.653
Republicans will never win
another election.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:25.025
These people were brought to our country
to vote and they vote illegally.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:28.762
And the, you know, amazing
that the Republicans are tougher on it.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:31.598
The Republicans should say,
we want to take over.

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.967
We should take over the voting,
the voting.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.869
And at least

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:40.607
many 15 places the Republicans
ought to nationalize the voting.

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:42.842
now one. I know I kind of
just hit you in the face with that clip.

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:44.744
I want to say welcome back to the Philip
DeFranco show.

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:46.312
It is Tuesday, February 30th.

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:48.348
Welcome back
to another daily dive into the news.

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:50.617
But that clip, it's crazy. I just.

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.485
First of all, though,
the Constitution gives states

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:53.920
broad discretion to determine

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.256
how they run their elections,
not the federal government.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:59.893
Second of all, 25 million undocumented
immigrants didn't come here under Biden.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:00.693
That's just a lie.

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:03.863
we don't have great data past 20, 23,
but Pew estimates at around

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:06.866
3.5 million had come in by that point,
putting the total population

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.001
at around 14 million.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.203
and third of all non-citizens do not vote.

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:12.705
Like putting aside
the few extremely rare edge cases

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.908
that are so negligible
that you can basically just say

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.209
non-citizens don't vote.

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.812
in fact, Trump's own administration's
probe into supposed

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:20.880
voter fraud has so far turned up
virtually nothing.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.617
reportedly, he had his DHS check
nearly 50 million voter registrations

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:29.155
and only about 10,000 or 0.02%
were referred for further investigation

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:29.956
of non citizenship.

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:31.724
and even assuming that
that number is accurate,

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.960
which it may not be, since officials
say that, you know,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.963
some people were mistakenly flagged,
that's only registered voters.

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:39.099
It says nothing about
how many actually voted.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.867
of course, yeah, none of this is new.

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:43.870
Election integrity has never been in doubt
for anyone but Donald Trump.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.272
And the people he suckered
into his delusional fantasy world.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.173
and so it seems like everyone

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:50.877
with a shred of sanity
left to care about honesty over loyalty.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.212
They're looking toward the midterms
this year

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:53.713
and just chewing their fingernails off.

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:54.247
right, as far as the

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:57.817
the 15 places or states where Trump says
that he wants to take over voting.

00:01:57.817 --> 00:02:00.987
He didn't name them, but he mentioned
a couple later on, including Minnesota.

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:01.688
it's a mess.

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:03.857
There's something in the water up
there. And I love the state.

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:06.960
I won the state three times,
but I got no credit for it.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:08.761
I won that state three times.

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:12.465
But it's a rigged state,
really rigged badly with the Somalians

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:14.801
and the Somalians and the theft.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:18.037
also you had him talking about Georgia,
where Trump's FBI seized truckloads

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:21.708
of 2020 ballots, voter rolls and scanner
images from Fulton County last week.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:23.276
Now you're going to see something in

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:26.880
Georgia where they were able to get
with a court order the ballots.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.915
You're going to see some interesting
things. Got that.

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:32.318
yeah, Trump is right that we have seen
some interesting things coming out, though

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:33.419
not what he's thinking.

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:37.524
instead I'm talking about how we saw,
of all people, Tulsi Gabbard on site

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:40.326
during the FBI raid.
that's really weird and concerning.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:43.496
I mean, we still don't have a very clear
answer as to why the director of

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:47.267
National intelligence with zero domestic
law enforcement authority would be there.

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:51.371
her job description does not, or rather,
should not include onsite involvement

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:52.705
in criminal investigative work.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:55.675
when lawmakers they pressed her about it,
she replied in the letter yesterday

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.744
that it does actually fall
under her purview

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.045
because intelligence suggests

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:01.447
election systems are vulnerable
to foreign interference.

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:04.551
but that also still doesn't explain
why she attended a different agencies

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:05.952
raid in Fulton County in particular.

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:09.055
In fact, she admitted that she hadn't
even seen the search warrant there.

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:09.155
right.

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:10.623
And Gabbard
actually added that she was there

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:13.993
because Trump personally asked her to be,
and as far as why Trump made

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:15.061
that request, one source

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:18.131
told the times that he wanted her
to assist with the FBI's investigation.

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.200
But now you actually have the Guardian
reporting that Gabbard

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.368
is running her own investigation
into the 2020

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:24.370
election, separate
from the DOJ investigation.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.072
And she's doing it with Trump's approval.

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:28.408
and reportedly,
she's been at it for months briefing

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:31.511
Trump and senior white House advisers
every few weeks on her progress.

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:31.878
with that,

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.314
you have a source saying that she actually
wasn't looking at Fulton County

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:37.617
until the FBI raid and other officials
saying that the white House had given her

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:40.687
far ranging authority to hunt for voter
fraud in multiple states.

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:42.322
and so apparently you've got Tulsi
Gabbard, cook it up.

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:43.790
Something much bigger than Fulton County.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.459
But even there, her involvement
was more than just an observer.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.629
because the day after the raid,
she met with some of the FBI agents,

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:50.830
called Trump on her cell phone

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.899
and put him on speaker
so that he could talk to them.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.200
All of which she admits.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.503
and he got sources telling the times
that Trump asked them questions and praise

00:03:57.503 --> 00:03:59.505
and thank them for their work
on the probe. one. Official.

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:01.174
Even adding
that the call was fairly short,

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:03.910
perhaps just a minute long,
and compared the conversation to a pep

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.146
rally or, coach giving an encouraging
halftime speech to his players.

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:07.847
now that same official

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:10.583
also claim that Trump gave
no substantive direction to the agents,

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.452
which is also something
that Gabbard told lawmakers.

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:14.988
And she added that he didn't even ask them
questions.

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.222
regardless of that last part, though,

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:19.325
the fact that this call even took
place is kind of nuts on its own.

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:20.727
I mean, as reports have noted, rather

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:23.429
than going to senior department
or FBI officials, Mr.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:26.866
Trump spoke directly to the frontline
agents doing the granular work

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:30.603
of a politically sensitive investigation
in which he has a large personal stake.

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:33.106
and of course, we can't forget the comment
that Trump made at Davos.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.642
people will soon be
prosecuted for what they did.

00:04:37.844 --> 00:04:40.246
It's probably
breaking news, but it should be.

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:43.249
actually speaking of prosecutions,
we can expect to see some fireworks

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:46.252
in the coming months from Trump,
so-called weaponization working group.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.988
That's his DOJ task force
that Pam Bondi whipped up last year.

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:49.656
And she says

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:52.725
that it's meant to investigate Biden's
weaponization of the DOJ against Trump.

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:54.260
But critics say that it's actually meant

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.362
to weaponize the DOJ against Trump's
enemies.

00:04:56.362 --> 00:04:56.963
you know, by the way,

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:57.830
it's been almost a year

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.767
now, and the group has nothing
to show for itself, at least not publicly.

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:03.136
so according to CNN, in recent weeks,
Trump's been pressuring

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:06.172
Justice Department officials were results
in these and other investigations.

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:09.175
And recently admonished a group of them
for failing to deliver on cases

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:09.942
that he wanted brought.

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:11.611
and so now this weaponization
working group

00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:13.646
is reportedly expected
to start meeting daily

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:15.848
with the goal of producing results
in the next few months.

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:18.084
and reportedly the groups had until now
at Martin.

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:20.320
He's been pushed aside them
reportedly keeping his title

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.523
is the department's pardon attorney,
but getting marginalized in his other role

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:25.525
as the group's head
because senior department officials

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:29.495
saw him as ineffective in pursuing cases
that Trump wants acted upon immediately.

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:29.662
Right.

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:33.232
Martin is also reportedly long run
deputy AG Todd Blanchard the wrong way.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.200
reportedly, Blanchard

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.935
took issue
with his lack of legal experience

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:38.071
and got especially annoyed
when Martin would go around him,

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:39.472
sometimes to the president himself,

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:41.474
sometimes to complain
that the department's leadership

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:43.976
wasn't moving quickly enough
to hold Trump's enemies to account.

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:44.977
But really, whatever the case, right?

00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:48.081
With new leadership at the helm
and the orange man demanding action,

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:49.816
this weaponization group,
it's going to be something

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:52.085
to keep an eye on this year,
especially since Trump's DOJ

00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:54.554
is charged or investigated,
just so many people already.

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:59.125
You've got John Bolton, Tish James,
James Comey, Jerome Powell, Lisa Cook, Don

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:00.193
lemon, all those Democrats

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:04.364
who reminded the military not to obey
unlawful orders and on and on and on.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.233
but also y'all, like Trump
isn't just weaponizing the DOJ.

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:08.968
They're also doing it with DHS.

00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:11.704
And we just learned about a new terrifying
method that they're using to do so.

00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:14.440
It's called an administrative subpoena
in the Department of Homeland Security

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.409
has been using them to target
American citizens,

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.845
specifically, what you're seeing
are protesters, students,

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:20.279
and those that vocally oppose them.

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:23.316
you know, we've talked fairly extensively
recently about administrative warrens,

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:25.618
but an administrative subpoena, it's
something different.

00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:28.020
It's a request for personal information
from an establishment,

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.891
like a school, workplace or even social
media platform about specific individuals,

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.793
a very notably,
this type of subpoena does not

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:36.162
require a judge or even grand juries
approval.

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:38.431
fact, you've got the Washington Post
reporting that officials

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:39.699
throughout the Department
of Homeland Security,

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:42.668
including mid-level roles,
have been given authority to approve

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:45.271
that's why you've got privacy
and civil rights groups accusing

00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:48.341
Trump, DHS, of using this authority
to strangle free speech.

00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:49.976
we've now
seen them used to get information

00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:53.713
about a Columbia student who participated
in a pro-Palestine protest to attempt

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:56.916
to identify Instagram users
who protested about Ice raids in LA,

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.419
and even try to get information
about the thousands of Minnesota

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.120
health care workers protesting Ice.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.222
also in some cases, it's smaller scale.
Yeah.

00:07:03.222 --> 00:07:04.023
The Washington Post,

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:07.026
for example, interviewing a man named John
who had an administrative subpoena

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:08.261
served on his Google account. Right.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:11.097
Apparently just sending an email
to a prosecutor threatening to deport

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:13.833
an immigrant back to Afghanistan,
whereas life would be in danger.

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:15.468
and that email reportedly
asked the prosecutor

00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:18.771
not to play Russian roulette
with the immigrants life and added,

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:20.106
on the side of caution.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:23.209
There's a reason the US government,
along with many other governments, don't

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:26.279
recognize the Taliban apply
principles of common sense and decency.

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:28.414
barely five hours later,
he got subpoenaed.

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:29.048
now with all this,

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:31.484
according to supporters, administrative
subpoenas are critical tools

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:33.953
that allow investigators
to skip the lengthy judicial process

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:36.055
when searching for information
that could, for example, help

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:38.024
track down a pedophile or drug trafficker.

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:39.725
But then you have a lot of experts,

00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:43.463
the lack of oversight and general secrecy,
it threatens core democratic principles.

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:45.898
And so, for example,
you had one law professor saying this vast

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:49.569
administrative power has remained opaque
even to those who receive these subpoenas.

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.471
And invisible to those it affects most.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.406
with that,
you had an attorney for the ACLU, adding,

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:56.275
there's no oversight ahead of time
and there's no ramifications

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:57.944
for having abused it after the fact.

00:07:57.944 --> 00:08:01.247
saying, as we are increasingly in a world
where unmasking critics is important

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:05.084
to the administration, this type of legal
process is ripe for that kind of abuse.

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:07.186
however,
legal experts are also noting that

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:10.556
even if the courts decide
that DHS is abusing its authority

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:12.925
with these subpoenas, it's unlikely
that they'll actually be forced

00:08:12.925 --> 00:08:15.661
to stop using it's a real consequences,
a real change here.

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:17.196
It seems to kind of be off the table.

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:19.765
but I will say that may not be the case
for the State Department, right.

00:08:19.765 --> 00:08:22.268
Because the State Department,
along with its secretary, Marco Rubio,

00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:25.505
have now been sued by a coalition
of immigration groups, attorneys and U.S.

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:26.038
citizens.

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:27.673
and specifically,
they're suing over a decision

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:30.042
announced last month to suspend
immigrant visa approvals

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:33.479
or nationals of 75 different countries,
the time that it was announced last month,

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:36.516
the reason was apparently to ensure
that new immigrants

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.718
will not extract wealth
from the American people.

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:40.820
Because according to that, Trump State
Department immigrants

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.021
from those 75 countries

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.757
take welfare from the American people
at unacceptable rates.

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:46.726
their announcement adding,
we are working to ensure

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:49.695
the generosity of the American people
will no longer be abused.

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:52.899
the countries in question
included Somalia, Haiti, Iran and Cuba,

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:55.535
which is notably where Secretary Marco
Rubio's own family is from.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.571
however, that the lawsuit against
the State Department was quick to dismiss

00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:01.641
the State Department's excuses,
calling it a demonstrably false claim

00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:03.809
and adding, many applicants for immigrant
visas

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:07.046
are not eligible for cash
welfare and remain ineligible for years.

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.447
also, the suit went on to say that

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:12.218
this suspension amounts to a ban on nearly
half of all immigrant visa applications.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.819
and so they're looking
to get the decision overturned.

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:15.855
But also that's not the only case
against Trump's

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:17.757
immigration crusade
that we're seeing play out in court.

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:19.625
in fact, a judge just blocked the Trump
administration's

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:22.628
plans to strip the special protection
status from Haitian immigrants

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:25.698
more than 350,000 Haitian immigrants
live and work in the U.S.

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:28.968
under what's called it
Temporary Protected Status, or TPS. TPS.

00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:32.405
It's given to those whose home countries
are unsafe to return for reasons

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.574
like a natural disaster
or political instability

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:37.777
in Haiti's case, it was activated in 2010
after a catastrophic earthquake.

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:40.079
And it's been extended multiple times
because of gang violence.

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.048
that status,
it was set to end today at the direction

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:43.849
of Homeland
Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:46.552
But then at the 11th hour,
a federal judge blocked

00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:48.321
the Trump administration
from ending the TPS.

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:50.856
And she just slammed Kristi
Noem, specifically.

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:52.191
We're just straight up
saying that Nome didn't

00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:53.793
have the authority to make this decision.

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:57.196
And adding that Noem's reasoning,
quote, focuses on Haitians outside

00:09:57.196 --> 00:10:00.299
the United States are here illegally
ignoring that Haitian TPS

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:01.968
holder is already live here and legally.

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:05.738
So, also adding that Noem quote ignores
altogether the billions that Haitian TPS

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:07.173
holders contribute to the economy.

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:10.476
so with all that, obviously Team Trump
not happy about this ruling.

00:10:10.476 --> 00:10:13.212
And you had Tricia McLauchlan, a
DHS spokesperson, saying.

00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:14.714
temporary means temporary.

00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:18.517
And the final word will not be from an
activist judge legislating from the bench.

00:10:18.517 --> 00:10:20.720
you know, in the meantime,
plaintiffs and countless other Haitian

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.555
immigrants are taking this as a win,
despite

00:10:22.555 --> 00:10:24.757
the near guarantee
that this case is far from over.

00:10:24.757 --> 00:10:26.959
so with that, you had one of the attorneys
for the plaintiffs saying,

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:28.461
although the government
will probably appeal,

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.963
today's ruling
allows Haitian TPS holders to breathe

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:33.232
a sigh of relief,
even if only a small one.

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:35.434
look forward to defending the court's
ruling on appeal.

00:10:35.434 --> 00:10:37.269
then also, while we're talking about her,
while she's,

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:40.272
you know, getting slammed by a judge,
Kristi Noem, she's actually making

00:10:40.272 --> 00:10:43.909
concessions with Democrats about Ice
agents, albeit, I'll say very small ones.

00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:44.443
Specifically,

00:10:44.443 --> 00:10:46.746
she just announced
that all Ice agents in Minneapolis

00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:48.614
will immediately begin
wearing body cameras.

00:10:48.614 --> 00:10:50.650
that policy,
they say, will spread nationwide

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.284
as soon as the funding is available.

00:10:52.284 --> 00:10:55.121
They'll also I'll say, you know, Noem
herself, she can hardly take credit here.

00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:57.823
the idea was actually proposed
by Republican Senator Ron Johnson

00:10:57.823 --> 00:11:01.327
as a concession that could keep Ice
funded as Democrats block financing.

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:03.129
at least they were blocking financing.

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:05.097
While I was recording today,
the House passed the bill

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:07.900
to end the partial government shutdown,
sending it to Trump's desk.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.236
and that is, you know, this minor change,
it definitely doesn't,

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:13.172
you know, do much to improve
ISIS reputation at home or abroad.

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:14.507
on that business and political line.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:16.842
We're seeing companies in countries
like France and Canada

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:19.578
either distancing themselves
from or cutting ties with U.S.

00:11:19.578 --> 00:11:20.546
entities over ice.

00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:22.715
then on more of a social
and personal side of things.

00:11:22.715 --> 00:11:24.850
You have the likes of podcasters
like Andrew Schultz

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.687
getting a ton of attention
for saying that he hit his breaking point

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.422
after watching how the administration
responded

00:11:29.422 --> 00:11:30.756
to the Alex Brady shooting. like,

00:11:30.756 --> 00:11:33.893
I didn't think what's happening right now
with Ice could happen in America.

00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:35.961
I genuinely did
not think that was possible.

00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:38.698
I thought our institution thought
the Constitution would hold up Like it

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:43.502
all of a sudden becomes not like, 
liberal, catastrophic thinking.

00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:46.772
It starts to become very reasonable,

00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:51.410
nuanced criticism of the administration
they have just done.

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:54.647
They have just made the, the, the,

00:11:54.647 --> 00:11:58.684
the most far left critiques of the Trump
administration.

00:11:58.684 --> 00:12:01.821
Their reaction to this has just justified
all of them.

00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:02.188
Yeah.

00:12:02.188 --> 00:12:06.025
Let me in one moment, in one moment,
all of their responses

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:10.563
from Trump to Kash Patel,
they have justified every single currency.

00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:12.098
And I know
people will probably look at this about

00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:15.067
they've done a million other things
to to justify them. Sure.

00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:15.835
And that's fair.

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:20.940
But this specific situation I think
is a breaking point and is justified.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.310
All those criticism,
I think people centenas are way up

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.613
and people's
antennas up that were not up initially.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.081
with all that,
you had people kind of seeing this

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:30.983
as Andrew kind of conceding that Trump's
critics, though,

00:12:30.983 --> 00:12:32.985
the people who were sounding the alarm
for years,

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:36.122
they may have been right all along,
or at least they were right on this issue.

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:37.356
you know, that ends up being a big deal,

00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:39.091
not only because his podcast
is pretty big, but

00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:42.695
because Andrew had Trump on his podcast
leading up to the 2024 election. so.

00:12:42.695 --> 00:12:45.798
That's also why you're seeing a lot of
mixed reactions to Andrew's comments here.

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:46.899
Are you some celebrating that

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:49.902
anyone who may have supported Trump,
they're seeing the light though

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:52.204
others are frustrated
that Andrew propped Trump up,

00:12:52.204 --> 00:12:53.706
and now he kind of wants to walk it back.

00:12:53.706 --> 00:12:56.208
I will say, you actually had his co-host
Charlamagne pushing on that front.

00:12:56.208 --> 00:13:01.046
Did you not believe
Trump would do any of the things

00:13:01.046 --> 00:13:03.215
that he said he was going to do
because you didn't know

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:05.117
or because you believed
in the guardrails of America?

00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:06.619
I believe in the guardrails of America.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:09.822
there are a lot of things that he ran
on, right, that were

00:13:10.523 --> 00:13:14.360
that were very seductive,
that seemed possible and seem very doable.

00:13:14.693 --> 00:13:18.197
And one by one backtracking
on these things you know, all of this,

00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:20.032
it does feel like it's
hitting on a conversation,

00:13:20.032 --> 00:13:22.168
a debate we're seeing play out at all
levels, mean,

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:24.603
whether it's personal and private
or I mean, Saturday Night Live,

00:13:24.603 --> 00:13:26.972
they just bit a sketch about this
kind of thing over the weekend.

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:28.607
just have ten toes down.

00:13:28.607 --> 00:13:31.143
The Trump supporters have been the MAGA
movement has been

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:32.978
some have referred to it
as cult like, idea

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:36.182
that even a small part of
it might be open to changing their minds.

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:37.116
It feels like a big deal.

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:40.319
also you've got plenty of people
still feeling angry, not trusting

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:43.656
these changes of heart and wanting to
just kind of scream, we told you so.

00:13:43.722 --> 00:13:46.258
and then there's even more
we've got to dive into in just a minute.

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:48.460
But first,
let me thank a sponsor and say, be honest.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.529
You know,
are you still landing in another country

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:54.300
and immediately sprinting to find Wi-Fi
like it's the final level of a video game?

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:58.270
if you do stop today's sponsor, salie,
it's your new travel essential.

00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:02.074
Sally's an eSIM app that lets you get
mobile data in 200 plus destinations

00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:06.145

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:06.912
download the app.

00:14:06.912 --> 00:14:09.748
Once you pick your plan,
install the easement. You're connected.

The moment you land, good.

00:14:10.816 --> 00:14:12.952
To order an Uber, open maps, text.

00:14:12.952 --> 00:14:16.322
People translate menus instantly
while everyone else is still begging

00:14:16.322 --> 00:14:19.225
airport Wi-Fi to load,
and safely keeps working across countries,

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:21.694
especially if you use their regional
or global plans.

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.662
One eSIM, multiple destinations.

00:14:23.662 --> 00:14:24.563
it's not just convenience.

00:14:24.563 --> 00:14:27.967
Celia's built in security features
like ad blocking and web protection,

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:30.436

pop ups and fake networks.

00:14:30.436 --> 00:14:32.104
and if your phone isn't eSIM compatible,

00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:34.506
they offer a full refund,
which is rare and appreciated.

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:37.643

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:44.683
before your next trip.

00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:48.454
but then diving right back into the new is
Bill and Hillary Clinton have now caved.

00:14:48.487 --> 00:14:51.423
Republican demands that they testify
before Congress on Jeffrey Epstein.

00:14:51.423 --> 00:14:55.060
But also Trump's DOJ has continued
to insist that the case is closed,

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.962
even as millions of files
remain unreleased.

00:14:56.962 --> 00:14:59.531
you know, starting with the Clintons,
this actually goes back to July,

00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:02.134
when you had House Democrats on the House
Oversight Committee forcing a vote

00:15:02.134 --> 00:15:05.304
to subpoena the DOJ for its files
regarding the investigation into Epstein.

00:15:05.304 --> 00:15:07.172
And the committee
also voted for additional subpoenas

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:08.674
against the Clintons, eight former top

00:15:08.674 --> 00:15:12.044
law enforcement officials and Glenn
Maxwell, who's currently serving a 20 year

00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:14.313
sentence on sex trafficking charges
in connection to her role

00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:16.882
recruiting girls on Epstein's behalf
and facilitating his abuse.

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:17.283
now, Maxwell.

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:19.251
She's scheduled to be deposed on
February 9th.

00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:21.754
And only one person,
former attorney general William Barr,

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:23.055
has already appeared to testify.

00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:24.757
also the Republican chair
of the oversight committee.

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:27.860
James Gomer has withdrawn the subpoenas
for five former attorneys general,

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.529
who wrote in statements to the panel
that they had no knowledge relevant

00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:33.632
to the investigation, you also have
the committee excusing former FBI Director

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:36.402
James Comey and Robert Mueller
from giving live depositions.

00:15:36.402 --> 00:15:39.438
one comer refused to excuse the Clintons,
although they repeatedly offered

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:41.941
to provide the same kind of
sworn statement that others had provided.

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:42.508
And two,

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:43.976
he also falsely accused them

00:15:43.976 --> 00:15:45.911
of ignoring the subpoenas,
despite their attorney

00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:47.780
sending multiple letters
trying to work something out.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.349
now that said comer
has been absolutely right when he claimed

00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:53.018
that the Clintons have been trying
to find a way out of testifying.

00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:54.286
they were originally scheduled to speak

00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:54.753
with the committee

00:15:54.753 --> 00:15:57.990
way back in October of 2025,
but then those sessions got delayed

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.459
until December
and then pushed back again to January.

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:02.261
After that, Clinton said
that they had to attend a funeral

00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:04.229
and then the Clintons told the committee
that they wouldn't

00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:06.632
participate in the rescheduled Closed-door
depositions at all.

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:08.834
this, even as Comber
threatened to kick off the process,

00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:10.936
to hold them in contempt of Congress,
which is punishable

00:16:10.936 --> 00:16:14.106
by up to a year in prison,
as well as a fine of up to $100,000.

00:16:14.173 --> 00:16:15.741
in fact,
we've seen this play out before, Trump

00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:17.876
ally Steve Bannon
and Peter Navarro, for example.

00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:21.113
They both served four months sentences
after being found in contempt of Congress

00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:24.283
in 2021 for defying a subpoena issued
by the committee investigating the January

00:16:24.283 --> 00:16:25.484
6th attack on the Capitol.

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:27.886
though I will say notably,
not every witness who defies

00:16:27.886 --> 00:16:29.722
a congressional subpoena is referred
for contempt.

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:31.991
Republican Representative
Jim Jordan of Ohio, for example,

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.493
he was among the Republican members
of Congress who received a subpoena

00:16:34.493 --> 00:16:37.463
as part of the Jan six investigation,
but he refused to cooperate.

00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:40.366
then, of course, also when Trump was
subpoenaed, he sued to try to block it.

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:42.001
And the committee
eventually withdrew the subpoena.

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:44.003
then as far as the Clintons,
their lawyers have argued

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:46.171
that the subpoenas that they received
are legally invalid,

00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:48.507
saying that this is nothing more
than a ploy to attempt

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:51.043
to embarrass political rivals,
as President Trump has directed.

00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:53.512
but then after they failed to show up
for their most recently scheduled

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:55.614
depositions,
the oversight committee passed resolutions

00:16:55.614 --> 00:16:57.282
to move forward
with holding them in contempt.

00:16:57.282 --> 00:16:57.950
And notably,

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.152
you had nine of the committee's
21 Democrats

00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:02.388
joining Republicans
in support of the charges against Bill,

00:17:02.388 --> 00:17:04.690
and three even supported the measures
against Hillary Clinton.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.159
so with all that, you
then had the Clintons agreeing to testify.

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:08.994
But first
they said that certain conditions

00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:10.863
would need to be met,
including one, interview

00:17:10.863 --> 00:17:13.866
needs to be limited in scope to matters
related to the investigations

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:15.034
and prosecutions of Epstein.

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:18.070
Two, that each session
would be no more than four hours long,

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:21.140
and three, that Bill Clinton
be allowed to bring his own transcriber.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.175
then we saw Comber reject that offer.

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:23.976
And last night,

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:25.811
the House Rules Committee met
to start the process

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:28.047
required to bring the contempt vote
to the House floor.

00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:30.816
But then you had the attorneys
for the Clintons emailing Comber

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:32.851
and saying that they would agree
to his demands,

00:17:32.851 --> 00:17:35.854
with a spokesperson adding on Twitter,
they negotiated in good faith.

00:17:35.854 --> 00:17:36.455
You did not.

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:39.124
They told you under oath what they know,
but you don't care.

00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:41.560
the former president and former
secretary of state will be there.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.430
They look forward to setting a precedent
that applies to everyone.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.565
so with that, the contempt proceedings
have been put on hold,

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:49.535
but they also haven't been called off,
with Comber saying in a statement,

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:50.369
the Clintons counsel

00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:52.738
has said they agreed to terms,
but those terms lacked

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:55.908
clarity yet again, and they provided
no dates for their depositions.

00:17:55.974 --> 00:17:58.410
clarify the terms they are agreeing to
and then discuss

00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.845
next steps with my committee members.

00:17:59.845 --> 00:18:01.647
then you also had speaker
Mike Johnson saying today

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:04.783
that the Clintons would have until noon
to provide details of how they plan

00:18:04.783 --> 00:18:07.119
to comply with the subpoenas
if they didn't want the contempt vote

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:07.886
to move forward.

00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:08.787
we'll have to see where this goes.

00:18:08.787 --> 00:18:10.155
But it does seem unlikely

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:13.192
that any new information would actually
come out of in-person testimony.

00:18:13.192 --> 00:18:13.425
neither.

00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:15.260
Glen has actually been accused
of any wrongdoing

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.496
in connection to Epstein,
and both have said that they don't know

00:18:17.496 --> 00:18:19.364
anything relevant
to the committee's investigation.

00:18:19.364 --> 00:18:21.767
but what we do know
is that Clinton was definitely acquainted

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:23.268
with Epstein, though he is believed

00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:25.204
to have cut off contact with him
two decades ago.

00:18:25.204 --> 00:18:27.506
And there's no evidence
that he's ever visited Epstein's island.

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:29.675
that said,
he did take four international trips

00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:33.212
on Epstein's private jet in 2002 and 2003,
according to flight logs.

00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:35.280
and he's also appeared in Epstein
related photographs

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.617
released by Congress in the DOJ,
including one showing him with Epstein,

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:41.653
another showing him in a pool
with Glenn Maxwell and two others

00:18:41.653 --> 00:18:42.888
showing him on a private plane

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:45.958
and in a hot tub alongside a woman or girl
whose face is redacted.

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:47.993
then as far as Hillary,
there's no known connection

00:18:47.993 --> 00:18:49.761
to Epstein
besides through her husband. right.

00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:50.729
And their lawyer has said that

00:18:50.729 --> 00:18:53.832
she had no personal knowledge of Epstein
or Maxwell's criminal activities,

00:18:53.832 --> 00:18:56.168
never flew on his aircraft,
never visited his island,

00:18:56.168 --> 00:18:58.103
and cannot recall ever
speaking to Epstein.

00:18:58.103 --> 00:18:59.838
Now, with all that said,
as far as what else we're seeing

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:01.073
with this latest Epstein Files

00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:04.243
release, we're seeing continued backlash
about what wasn't released.

00:19:04.243 --> 00:19:06.145
And also the the way
the whole thing's been handled.

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:08.714
right as we've talked about,
you had survivors, understandably outrage

00:19:08.714 --> 00:19:10.449
after the files
appeared to expose the names of

00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:14.219
at least 43 of them, along with there
being dozens of unredacted nude images.

00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:16.822
Or the DOJ actually leaving
all of that unredacted initially,

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:18.824
even while taking the time, apparently,
to black out

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:21.126
significant chunks of the files
for no apparent reason.

00:19:21.126 --> 00:19:23.562
that's actually why you had Ro Khanna
and Thomas Massey arguing

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:26.765
that the redactions appear to not comply
with the Epstein Files Transparency Act,

00:19:26.765 --> 00:19:29.735
which requires that no document
be withheld or redacted

00:19:29.735 --> 00:19:33.038
based on embarrassment, reputational harm
or political sensitivity?

00:19:33.038 --> 00:19:36.441
And all of that is you have Democrats now
accusing the DOJ of breaking the law

00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:39.111
by continuing to withhold
as much as 50% of the files,

00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:42.381
even though we're now well over a month
past the December 19th deadline.

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:46.552
you know, that 50% number deputy AG
Todd Blanch has explained that by saying

00:19:46.552 --> 00:19:48.153
that the department had initially found

00:19:48.153 --> 00:19:51.290
6 million pages of documents
identified as potentially responsive,

00:19:51.323 --> 00:19:54.426
he said that they aired on the side
of over collection of materials

00:19:54.426 --> 00:19:57.429
from various sources
to best ensure maximum transparency.

00:19:57.496 --> 00:19:57.930
then with that,

00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.965
he said that
the number of responsive pages

00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:00.866
is significantly smaller

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:03.001
than the total number of pages
initially connected,

00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:05.637
which is why only around
3.5 million pages were released.

00:20:05.637 --> 00:20:07.105
you've also I'll say had Blanch

00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:09.508
appearing on Fox News
a doubling down on his assertion

00:20:09.508 --> 00:20:12.711
that the release of these files
means that the whole Epstein saga is over.

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:18.183
any chance that any of these individuals
who partied with Epstein and engaged in,

00:20:19.618 --> 00:20:20.052
you know,

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:23.055
relations with minors will be prosecuted?

00:20:23.322 --> 00:20:26.258
Well, the chance we I'll never say

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:29.494
no, and we will always investigate
any evidence of misconduct.

00:20:29.494 --> 00:20:32.731
But as you know,
it is not a crime to party with Mr.

00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:33.198
Epstein.

00:20:33.198 --> 00:20:36.068
And so, as horrible
as it's not a crime to email with Mr.

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:39.538
Epstein, and then some of these men
may have done horrible things.

00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:40.739
And if we have evidence

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:44.109
that allows us to prosecute them,
you better believe we will.

00:20:44.109 --> 00:20:46.511
and there,
I will say he is technically right.

00:20:46.511 --> 00:20:49.481
It is not technically a crime
to have a party with Epstein in it.

00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:51.116
It doesn't seem like anything in the files
released

00:20:51.116 --> 00:20:53.819
so far would be enough
to prosecute anyone. one.

00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:56.955
Especially on the timing
of the conversations and relationship.

00:20:56.955 --> 00:21:00.259
It would show that person's
character and judgment.

00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:00.392
Right.

00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:02.728
Whether they should be
in positions of power, people

00:21:02.728 --> 00:21:06.498
you work with around children know,
just as a precautionary thing,

00:21:06.498 --> 00:21:09.067
until you have many saying
that having parted with Epstein or,

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:10.902
you know, the other things
that we've learned from the files, it's

00:21:10.902 --> 00:21:12.237
a reason to keep on digging.

00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:12.971
and that's actually a point you

00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:15.774
at John Stewart really hammering
home on The Daily Show last night.

00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:17.175
they've been on the plane.

00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:19.678
They've been on the island.
They've been to his house.

00:21:19.678 --> 00:21:22.147
They've given him creepy cards
with pubic hair.

00:21:22.147 --> 00:21:26.318
They've been accused by a multitude
of women, of a multitude of wrongdoings.

00:21:26.451 --> 00:21:31.356
And nothing has happened
to any of them, also,

00:21:31.356 --> 00:21:33.825
you had Stewart connecting this
to the broader political situation,

00:21:33.825 --> 00:21:35.427
especially the Trump
administration's efforts

00:21:35.427 --> 00:21:38.163
to crack down on immigration
as well as sanctuary cities.

00:21:38.163 --> 00:21:43.568
seems pretty clear to me that there is
a sanctuary city in this country.

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:44.736
But guess what?

00:21:44.736 --> 00:21:47.339
This kid don't live in it.

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:51.343
The real sanctuary city
is where money and power protect you

00:21:51.343 --> 00:21:55.480
from the consequences of sex
trafficking or influence peddling,

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.918
or taking half $1 billion and giving away
America's AI infrastructure.

00:22:01.053 --> 00:22:01.920
Not the small

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.824
Midwestern city where trying to help
a lady get up after she gets maced

00:22:05.957 --> 00:22:09.294
gets you shot in the back of the head.

00:22:10.462 --> 00:22:13.231
That's the real sanctuary city.

00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:16.234
And these are the motherfuckers who live
there.

00:22:16.968 --> 00:22:18.904
Give me the right picture.

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:20.605
Yeah.

00:22:20.605 --> 00:22:22.541
included in Stewart's
version of the sanctuary city

00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:26.445
is everyone from Bill Clinton to Bill
Gates and Steve Bannon and Elon Musk.

00:22:26.445 --> 00:22:29.181
And of course, right at the tip
or the top is Donald Trump.

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:32.284
with Trump, you had him defending himself
in a post on truth social writing.

00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:33.285
Unlike so many people

00:22:33.285 --> 00:22:37.222
that like to talk trash, I never went to
the infested Epstein Island.

00:22:37.222 --> 00:22:40.292
But almost all of these crooked Democrats
and their donors did.

00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:42.661
but then also notably at the same time
as he was implying

00:22:42.661 --> 00:22:45.397
that his political opponents
might be involved in Epstein's crimes,

00:22:45.397 --> 00:22:47.032
he also suggested that releasing

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:50.068
more documents or investigating further,
it would just be a waste of time.

00:22:50.068 --> 00:22:50.535
Guys.

00:22:50.535 --> 00:22:54.172
the DOJ, I think, should just say
we have other things to do

00:22:54.172 --> 00:22:57.442
and interestingly, we've also seen
similar inconsistencies from Elon Musk.

00:22:57.442 --> 00:22:57.576
Right.

00:22:57.576 --> 00:22:58.844
Ever since the latest files appear

00:22:58.844 --> 00:23:02.414
to show that he was just blatantly lying
about refusing to go to Epstein's island,

00:23:02.414 --> 00:23:06.251
and that he, in fact, emailed Epstein
multiple times about visiting, even asking

00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:09.187
when the wildest party would be,
Musk has been trying to shift attention

00:23:09.187 --> 00:23:12.424
to Democratic Megadonor
Reed Hoffman, posting pages from the files

00:23:12.424 --> 00:23:14.493
showing that the fellow billionaire
visited the island.

00:23:14.493 --> 00:23:17.262
And you have Musk actually claiming
that nobody has fought for full release

00:23:17.262 --> 00:23:20.766
of Epstein files and prosecutions of those
who abuse children more than he did.

00:23:20.766 --> 00:23:22.567
you know, to be fair,
he did call for their release

00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:25.170
several times in the past,
especially after he claimed in a post

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.339
last year
that Trump was in the Epstein files.

00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:29.975
And that was actually the real reason
they hadn't been made public.

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:30.809
that that is a post

00:23:30.809 --> 00:23:32.677
he has since deleted,
and he's really tried

00:23:32.677 --> 00:23:34.980
to ingratiate himself
more with the administration. Again.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.681
and now you have him sharing a post
claiming that

00:23:36.681 --> 00:23:39.551
the major takeaways from the new files
are that Epstein loved

00:23:39.551 --> 00:23:42.254
Democrats, liberal elites,
but hated Donald Trump.

00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:44.489
and so that's been one argument
that Trump supporters have tried to use

00:23:44.489 --> 00:23:46.658
to say that the files
actually prove Trump's innocence.

00:23:46.658 --> 00:23:47.125
but one.

00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:49.094
If you actually go through
so many of these files,

00:23:49.094 --> 00:23:50.729
that is not what these files show.

00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:53.632
two, I'll say it's also disheartening
that in the United States, it feels like

00:23:53.632 --> 00:23:57.169
there's really no accountability
outside of, like, a CBS news contributor.

00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:59.438
But outside of the United States, like,
there are a number of people

00:23:59.438 --> 00:24:01.740
having to resign
or being kicked out, and three.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.341
What it seems like a lot of Trump's
defenders

00:24:03.341 --> 00:24:06.144
don't realize is the people out there
that are really pushing for justice.

00:24:06.144 --> 00:24:09.981
They want anyone, Democrat or Republican,
to be prosecuted or held accountable.

00:24:09.981 --> 00:24:12.551
right. Depending on how they were involved
or what they were doing.

00:24:12.551 --> 00:24:13.785
I'll say it. It's very unfortunate.

00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:17.122
Merrick Garland, I think, was very slow,
very kind of worthless.

00:24:17.189 --> 00:24:18.723
then in came this Trump administration.

00:24:18.723 --> 00:24:21.793
And you've had them fighting this
the entire time.

00:24:21.893 --> 00:24:23.395
That's why
I feel like I have to repeat myself

00:24:23.395 --> 00:24:26.064
constantly, whether it be this
or in a number of other situations,

00:24:26.064 --> 00:24:30.302
it should be less about left versus right
and elites versus everyone else.

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:32.237
but then actually the final thing
we need to talk about today

00:24:32.237 --> 00:24:33.171
is that French authorities

00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:36.441
just raided Z's Paris headquarters
as part of an investigation

00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:40.345
into a slew of crimes, including child
sexual abuse imagery and Holocaust denial.

00:24:40.345 --> 00:24:40.412
write.

00:24:40.412 --> 00:24:43.849
They actually also summoned Elon
Musk to answer questions in the case,

00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:46.451
now, of course, you know
this is obviously coming as X and Gronk.

00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:47.018
They've been facing

00:24:47.018 --> 00:24:50.188
a ton of international backlash
over sexual deepfakes on the platform.

00:24:50.188 --> 00:24:53.024
But France's investigation
actually started over a year ago.

00:24:53.024 --> 00:24:54.860
Where prosecutors were first
looking into issues

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.895
with X's algorithm
and how it handles data.

00:24:56.895 --> 00:24:58.964
But the investigation is now widened
to look at

00:24:58.964 --> 00:25:00.565
a total of seven different offenses.

00:25:00.565 --> 00:25:03.969
so the authorities are alleging that
CSA images started increasing last year

00:25:03.969 --> 00:25:07.572
after X rolled back detection tools,
resulting in fewer images being flagged.

00:25:07.572 --> 00:25:08.940
authorities also pointed to issues

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.909
with anti-Semitism,
which is the most surprising thing.

00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:14.079
I mean, we all saw Graco
Mega Hitler last year, And Gronk has also

00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:17.215
been accused of denying the Holocaust
by claiming that gas chambers in Auschwitz

00:25:17.215 --> 00:25:21.653
were designed for disinfection with Zyklon
B against typhus, not mass murder.

00:25:21.653 --> 00:25:22.854
one of the biggest things here is that

00:25:22.854 --> 00:25:25.891
France has some of the strictest Holocaust
denial laws in the world.

00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:26.691
and so that's why today,

00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:29.895
France's cyber crime unit and Europol
searched the company's offices.

00:25:29.895 --> 00:25:32.864
The country's prosecutor's office
also deleted its account shortly

00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:33.732
after announcing the raid.

00:25:33.732 --> 00:25:36.234
And with this, you had the lawmaker
whose complaint opened up

00:25:36.234 --> 00:25:39.471
this investigation, writing in Europe,
and particularly in France,

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:43.608
the rule of law means that no one is above
the law and that European regulations,

00:25:43.608 --> 00:25:46.578
once transposed into French law,
are binding on everyone.

00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:47.913
you know, leading into this last year,

00:25:47.913 --> 00:25:48.380
you had ex

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.614
responding to this investigation

00:25:49.614 --> 00:25:52.851
by calling it politically motivated,
denying any wrongdoing, claiming it

00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:55.887
the probe is undermining this fundamental
right to due

00:25:55.887 --> 00:25:58.924
process and threatens our users
right to privacy and free speech.

00:25:58.924 --> 00:26:01.226
and well, so far,
at least as of recording this Musk himself

00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:03.862
hasn't publicly addressed
the latest raid this morning on.

00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:06.831
He did respond to a general post
about social media crackdowns in Europe

00:26:06.831 --> 00:26:09.034
by saying tyrants love censorship.

00:26:09.034 --> 00:26:11.303
you know, all of that
is he is facing a voluntary summons

00:26:11.303 --> 00:26:14.072
for questioning, as is former CEO
Linda Carino.

00:26:14.072 --> 00:26:16.341
reports also noting that this comes
as European governments

00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:18.743
and American tech companies
have been at odds for a while now.

00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:20.378
Is your abuse free speech differently?

00:26:20.378 --> 00:26:23.348
And they have stricter ideas of how social
media platforms should be regulated.

00:26:23.348 --> 00:26:23.448
Right.

00:26:23.448 --> 00:26:25.951
As you had the New York Times
explaining, Europeans see their actions

00:26:25.951 --> 00:26:29.354
as a democratic prerogative necessary
to protect citizens from abuse.

00:26:29.387 --> 00:26:32.557
then adding the Trump administration
sees the fines as an unfair money grab

00:26:32.557 --> 00:26:33.892
from American companies and considers

00:26:33.892 --> 00:26:35.827
the regulations
to be an attack on free speech.

00:26:35.827 --> 00:26:36.795
and actually on that note, France

00:26:36.795 --> 00:26:38.730
isn't the only country
to crack down on acts lately.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:40.732
Today you also had the Information
Commissioner's Office

00:26:40.732 --> 00:26:42.734
in the UK
announcing a formal investigation

00:26:42.734 --> 00:26:46.104
into acts over its personal data
processing and grok sexualized deepfakes.

00:26:46.104 --> 00:26:48.440
also just last week,
the European Union issued its inquiry

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.574
into the deepfake issue.

00:26:49.574 --> 00:26:51.409
and while so far, you know,
there have been no charges

00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:54.145
filed in France will have to keep an eye
on where this investigation goes.

00:26:54.145 --> 00:26:57.782
And if Musk actually directly responds
to the summons and answers questions.

00:26:57.849 --> 00:26:59.384
that my friends, you beautiful bastards.

00:26:59.384 --> 00:27:02.287
Brings us to the end of today's Philip
DeFranco show. Thank you for watching.

00:27:02.287 --> 00:27:04.889
Thank you for being a part
of these daily dives into the news.

00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:08.126
And I'll see you right back here tomorrow
to dive through more of it together.
