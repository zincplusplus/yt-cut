00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.135
CBS banned
Stephen Colbert from interviewing

00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:03.203
a Democratic Senate candidate

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.638
and then told him he couldn't
even mentioned the ban.

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:06.306
the Colbert

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:07.974
he used what I think
a lot of people have misplace

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:10.543
these days his backbone
and he mentioned it anyway.

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:11.611
And now that interview,

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.480
which was really supposed to air
to maybe a few hundred

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.249
thousand people, has been seen by millions
and millions of people

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.386
because the FCC and CBS to Streisand
affected themselves.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:20.320
when we first learned about this,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.622
because Colbert opened his show last night
saying.

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:25.125
you know who is not
one of my guests tonight.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.528
That's Texas
state representative James Talarico.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.366
He was supposed to be here,
but we were told in no uncertain terms

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.369
by our network's lawyers
who called us directly

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:39.172
that we could not have him
on the broadcast.

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:40.607
Then.

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:43.943
Then I was told in some uncertain terms
that not only could

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:48.014
I not have him on,
I could not mention me not having him on.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.918
And because my network clearly doesn't

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:55.121
want us to talk about this,
let's talk about this.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:55.889
Brian.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:58.792
We've been talking about Colbert Network
a lot lately at CBS.

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.660
over the last year, CBS
and its parent company,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.962
Paramount, Skydance,
they've been bending over backwards

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:05.231
to appease Trump ever since David
Ellison took ownership.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:08.368
among other things, CBS news has been
accused of morphing into Fox News lied.

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:11.438
Its chief pulled a 60 minutes story
critical of an immigration detention

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.573
center used under the Trump
administration, and last year

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:15.742
they announced they were pulling the plug
on Colbert Show.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:16.876
that was a move that many viewed

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:20.013
as currying favor with Donald
Trump and CBS's rightward shift.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:21.448
It's been really well documented.

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:24.517
and all of that brings us to the Democrat
running to unseat Republican John Cornyn

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:25.418
in a major Senate race.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:26.486
James Talarico.

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:26.586
right?

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:29.756
In Texas, you have Cornyn facing
a primary challenge from AG Ken Paxton.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.759
And Talarico is facing off against Jasmine
Crockett in the Democratic primary.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.294
and Democrats in Texas have not won

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:38.198
a statewide election in Texas for decades,
this race has become very chaotic.

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:40.667
And Democrats are hoping that
they can actually pave a path forward.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.902
right as far as this ban,
as far as this controversy,

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:46.172
you had Colbert explaining that it deals
with the FCC's equal time rule,

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:48.875
which says that if a broadcast network
gives airtime to one candidate,

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:50.977
then their opponent
is entitled to equal airtime,

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:52.345
and when news and talk show
interviews have long

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:53.746
been considered exceptions to the rule.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:57.050
Earlier this year, you had Trump's FCC
chairman, Brendan Carr, releasing a letter

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.452
suggesting that talk show interview
should maybe not be exempt

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.654
from the equal time rule,
especially if they're, quote,

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:03.389
motivated by Partizan purposes.

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:04.691
and for those unfamiliar
with Brendan Carr,

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:06.392
maybe you haven't seen us
talk about him in the past.

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:09.896
One of his favorite pastimes is to, to
lick the bottom of Trump's filthy boots.

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:11.798
And he hates
anyone who doesn't follow suit.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:15.201
he probably has no issue pinning Colbert
as to Partizan for an exemption, though.

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:16.769
Colbert he disagrees.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.772
Michael Baker thinks that car is actually
the one motivated by Partizan purposes.

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:20.373
And he argued.

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:22.542
Donald Trump's
administration wants to silence anyone

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:26.579
who says anything bad about Trump on TV
because all Trump does is watch TV.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.515
and you also had Colbert noting that
just a week ago,

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:31.751
the FCC actually opened a probe
into the view for interviewing Talarico.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:35.155
And his candidacy has really been at
the center of the FCC's politics lately.

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.557
know all that said, right
to to get around the equal time rule

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:39.526
you had Colbert
still interviewing Talarico,

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:42.328
but instead uploading it to YouTube
instead of airing it on TV, Right.

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:42.962
Because the rule is

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:46.432
it only applies to radio and broadcast
television, not streaming or social media.

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.368
what we saw in this interview
that was banned from TV

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:50.336
is that even though
there's political heat on him,

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:53.540
Talarico wasn't afraid to call out Trump
and CBS for the censorship.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:57.343
think that Donald Trump is worried
that we're about to flip Texas

00:02:57.343 --> 00:03:00.813
This is the party
that ran against cancel culture.

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:06.386
And now they're trying to control
what we watch, what we say, what we read.

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:09.956
And this is the most dangerous
kind of cancel culture,

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:11.824
the kind that comes from the top.

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:14.460
now, as far as the backlash with all this,
you have people comparing this to

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.997
when ABC and Kimmel off the air last year
after being threatened by Trump's FCC.

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:20.733
you also had Senator Chris Murphy writing
this is a censorship state.

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:23.169
Is censorship
a conservative value is that way.

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.638
Republicans are silent about this. No,
of course not.

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:28.808
They are just happy to let Trump try
to rig our politics because they benefit.

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:32.712
you also had Representative Yasmin Ansari
echoing that, saying the right hates

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:33.346
freedom of speech

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.348
because their policies
are largely unpopular,

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:38.484
and implementing them requires shutting
people up and a lack of opposition.

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:40.386
meanwhile, you had other
is tying it to the ongoing

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:42.255
corporate deals at CBS and Paramount.

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:44.824
saying the real reason CBS
didn't let Colbert air is interview

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:48.428
with James Talarico is that the Ellison's
are still trying to buy Warner Brothers.

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:50.964
And David Ellison runs Paramount,
which owns CBS.

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:52.031
he's using CBS to show

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:56.236
what loyal oligarchs they are
as they seek FCC approval for a deal.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.770
and over all, you just have so many people

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.806
giving Colbert props
for calling his network out. so.

00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:01.674
He was told not to say anything and did.

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:05.278
So anyways, this man is not getting enough
credit for standing up for free speech.

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:05.378
Right.

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:05.778
In with all this,

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:09.282
you've got people pushing back against car
and the FCC for enforcing the equal time

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:12.318
rule against bear like this, claiming
that it's not how it works.

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:14.053
with a bulwarks
Tim Miller, for example, saying

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:18.258
this would basically mean no presidential
primary candidates in 2027 on network TV

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:21.694
because none of the shows are going
to talk to all the loser also rans.

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:24.130
but also you've got some people
and I include myself in this camp.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.166
I think this is really one of the best
things that could have happened to Tyler.

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.001
Egos campaign. right.

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:30.270
He's making national headlines
because you essentially have the Trump

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.006
administration in a big corporation
trying to censor him

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:34.574
and the views
are still going up on YouTube

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:37.343
and all these other platforms,
we're talking seven figure views.

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:38.311
is another case.

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:39.078
The Streisand effect.

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:41.381
In attempting to mute Colbert
and Tyler echo,

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:44.851
the FCC and CBS actually ensured
that even more people would be watching.

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:46.419
you know. Well, yes, that is a win.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.088
This still is something you need
to be concerned about because, you know,

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:50.056
watching the FCC

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:53.126
get weaponized in real time to chill
political speech on broadcast TV.

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:54.661
It's scary, and it matters.

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:56.329
the equal time
rule exists to prevent networks

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:58.064
from giving unfair advantages
to candidates.

00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:00.233
But talk shows have been exempt
from this rule for decades

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:01.834
because news and interview programs

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:04.237
serve a different function
than campaign advertisements.

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:05.705
Johnny Carson interviewed candidates.

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:08.708
Letterman interviewed candidates
Stewart, Colbert, Fallon, Kimmel.

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:10.743
All of them have interviewed candidates
for years

00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:12.478
without triggering equal time
requirements.

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.347
then you get partizan figures like car.

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:17.050
You get corporations
whether they are complicit

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.951
or they're scared bending the knee.

00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:19.852
that's a big part of this,

00:05:19.852 --> 00:05:22.822
because the interview does not violate
any clear rule right now.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:25.024
What we are seeing is a chilling effect
in action.

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:26.426
and understand self-censorship.

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:29.996
It is just a stop on the way
to explicit government censorship.

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:32.865
this is not a new playbook.
It is just new to us.

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:34.300
and while Tyler Ricos interview
getting millions

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.436
of more views on YouTube
than it would have gotten on CBS.

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:39.372
Yes, it is satisfying.
It does not solve the underlying problem.

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:41.841
because if and when this becomes more
and more of the norm,

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:44.677
most candidates aren't going to get
that Streisand effect into virality.

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:45.345
most late night host.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.614
They do not have Colbert's platform
or willingness to defy their networks.

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:49.115
Lawyers.

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:49.248
and well,

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:51.451
you can do things
like contacting CBS yourself

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:53.019
and telling them
that this is unacceptable.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.822
And, you know, CBS is public contact
information is available out there.

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:59.092
you can also support and praise those
in the mainstream that fight back.

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:00.460
You can support independents

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.762
and you can support organizations
fighting for press freedom.

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:04.764
where you've got groups
like the Committee to Protect Journalists,

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:06.966
the freedom of the Press Foundation
in America,

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:08.534
tracking threats to independent journalism

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:10.937
and pushing back against government
intimidation of media.

00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:13.139
and also, if you're angry, stay angry.

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.674
Be loud about make it public.

00:06:14.674 --> 00:06:16.876
Because the only counter
to corporate capitulation.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:18.077
It is public pressure.

00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:19.846
and actually
on the note of public pressure

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:22.148
and how I can move things along,
let's talk about Epstein.

00:06:22.148 --> 00:06:23.716
because there's a lot to talk about here.

00:06:23.716 --> 00:06:25.818
New Mexico
just launched the first full investigation

00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:29.288
into Epstein Zorro Ranch with subpoena
power and plans and name perpetrators.

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:32.759
Publicly, you have Hillary Clinton
accusing Trump of a continuing cover up,

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:34.827
Trump claiming
that he's been totally exonerated

00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:36.996
despite his name
appearing thousands of times in the files

00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:40.600
and high profile executives there
resigning and having to face consequences.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.101
While Trump has been zero. here.

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:43.870
But let's start with the lawmakers
in New Mexico

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.972
who launched a sweeping investigation
into Epstein

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:48.408
Zorro Ranch over allegations
that he used the property

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:50.543
to sexually abuse
and traffic women and girls.

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:51.644
because yesterday,
here at the state House,

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:53.846
they're voting unanimously on a bill
to create a subcommittee

00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:55.314
that will investigate
what happened at the mansion

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:59.218
outside of Santa Fe that Epstein
owned from 1993 until his death in 2019.

00:06:59.218 --> 00:06:59.285
Right.

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:01.554
That's massive because it marks
the first full investigation

00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:03.689
of the property,
despite incredibly serious allegations

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:04.924
that have been swirling for years.

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:07.794
multiple girls and women have claimed
that they were abused at the ranch,

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:10.763
which appears numerous times in
the Epstein files of the DOJ, is released.

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:13.633
while law enforcement authorities raided
Epstein's other properties his New York

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:17.036
townhouse, Palm Beach mansion, Paris
apartment and Epstein Island.

00:07:17.036 --> 00:07:19.439
There have been no holistic inquiries
into Zorro Ranch.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.641
it seems that federal officials
may have even scuttled

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:23.476
a state level investigation in the past.

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:25.244
Right after Epstein's arrest in 2019, the

00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:27.980
then attorney general in New Mexico
launched a probe into the property.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.383
But the state's AG's office
put those efforts on hold

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:31.918
after federal prosecutors in New York

00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:34.020
told them to back off
because the federal investigation

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.855
was already covering
multiple jurisdictions.

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:38.191
then in December of 2019,
a federal prosecutor

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:41.294
told the executor of Epstein's estate
in an email that federal agents

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:42.929
had not searched the New Mexico property.

00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:44.897
and numerous state
and local officials in New Mexico

00:07:44.897 --> 00:07:47.600
have said that they were not aware
of any federal search

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.169
at the ranch Britain,
since the DOJ started releasing files,

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:50.837
there's been increased

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:52.839
scrutiny of the ranch
and the fact that there doesn't

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:54.941
appear to have been any real investigation
into it.

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:57.543
Trump administration,
they have done fuck all about anything.

00:07:57.543 --> 00:07:59.946
And instead they've chosen to gaslight
the American people.

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:02.215
Whenever someone asks
if they might consider new probes

00:08:02.215 --> 00:08:04.217
in light of the damning evidence
that's been released.

00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:06.686
is even after state officials
repeatedly asked the administration

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:09.489
to investigate allegations
that the bodies of two girls were buried

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.357
near the ranch,
which is a claim from an anonymous

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:13.593
email made public in the latest Epstein
files dump.

00:08:13.593 --> 00:08:15.962
the Trump administration's refusal to do
anything is exactly why

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:18.965
state lawmakers said that they needed
to take matters into their own hands.

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:21.367
Representative Andrea Romero,
who sponsored the bill

00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:23.970
to create the subcommittee, argued
that the case has been mishandled

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.738
and pushed out of the purview
for many years

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:27.673
and adding,
have heard years of allegations

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:29.842
and rumors
about Epstein's activities in New Mexico.

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:30.776
But unfortunately,

00:08:30.776 --> 00:08:33.646
federal investigations have failed
to put together an official record.

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:34.413
with that saying,

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:37.483
the subcommittee can finally fill
in the gaps by investigating the failures

00:08:37.483 --> 00:08:40.786
that led to the horrific allegations
of abuse and crime at Zorro Ranch,

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:43.089
so we can learn from them and prevent
such atrocities

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:44.757
from taking place in our state
going forward.

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:46.425
these state lawmakers
don't appear to be fucking around.

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:46.559
Right.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:49.428
Romero says that one of the goals
is going to be to gather information

00:08:49.428 --> 00:08:51.664
that could be used in court
for future prosecutions.

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:52.164
the panel.

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:56.068
It'll be given power to issue subpoenas,
access public records and seek testimony

00:08:56.068 --> 00:08:57.403
from survivors of alleged abuse,

00:08:57.403 --> 00:09:00.006
as well as local residents
who may have relevant information.

00:09:00.006 --> 00:09:00.640
And lawmakers say

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.843
that key pieces of evidence will be used
to identify people who visited the ranch,

00:09:03.843 --> 00:09:06.846
as well as state and local officials
who may have known what was going on.

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:08.681
that's notable
because the files have already revealed

00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:09.749
ties between Epstein

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:12.785
and two former Democratic governors
and an attorney general of New Mexico.

00:09:12.852 --> 00:09:13.953
a lawyer for Epstein survivors

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:15.721
even telling reporters
that local politicians

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:18.190
and others were aware
of what was happening at the ranch.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.294
unlike the Trump administration,
they are not afraid to name names.

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:21.460
Right?

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.862
Romero has vowed that the committee

00:09:22.862 --> 00:09:24.997
will publicly identified
suspected perpetrators.

00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:26.632
while
the panel is officially starting today,

00:09:26.632 --> 00:09:28.167
they're not expected to release interim

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:31.170
findings until July, with a final report
set for the end of the year.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.006
And then we have lawmakers in New Mexico
taking steps to uncover the truth.

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:36.175
You have Hillary Clinton
accusing the Trump administration

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:38.811
of launching a full scale coverup
while speaking to BBC.

00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:40.513
And what we're seeing,

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:44.817
I think it's fair to say, is a continuing
coverup by the Trump administration.

00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:47.820
So there's something, about this

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.524
administration's attitude toward this,
which I think

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:54.994
really leads us to conclude
they have something to hide.

00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:56.128
We don't.

00:09:56.128 --> 00:10:00.666
We have been willing to say
whatever we know.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.302
the files out. They are slow walking it.

00:10:03.302 --> 00:10:06.505
They are redacting
the names of men who are in it.

00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:10.776
They are stonewalling legitimate requests
from members of Congress.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.678
That has nothing to do with us.

00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:15.681
Something is going on. They know it.

00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:16.515
I know it. Right.

00:10:16.515 --> 00:10:18.351
Now, with Clinton noting that both
she and her husband

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:20.853
have both agreed to testify
before the House about Epstein

00:10:20.853 --> 00:10:23.189
after Republicans threatened to hold them
in contempt of Congress

00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:25.591
in arguing
that this whole thing is just a diversion,

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:28.027
and accusing Republican House leaders
of trying to protect Trump.

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:31.330
the with that you had Trump hitting back
at the Clintons I have nothing to hide.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.433
I've been exonerated, and I have nothing
to do with Jeffrey Epstein.

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:37.870
They went in hoping that they find it
and found just the opposite.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.171
I've been totally exonerated.

00:10:39.171 --> 00:10:40.840
they're getting called in,

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.376
and that's their problem,
and they got to see what happens.

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:47.380
But I watched her in Munich, and she
seriously has Trump Derangement syndrome.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.148
Do you think she should publicly tell you
that?

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:51.651
I've been totally exonerated on Epstein?

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:54.654
And it's really interesting
because they've been pulled in.

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:55.721
Think of it.

00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:59.759
They've been pulled in Clinton and
many other Democrats have been pulled in.

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:03.095
but with that, I understand Trump has not
been totally exonerated by the files.

00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:06.265
No matter how many times he says it,
it does not make it remotely true.

00:11:06.265 --> 00:11:09.268
his name is mentioned thousands
and thousands of times.

00:11:09.268 --> 00:11:11.270
If anything, it shows
his relationship with Epstein

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.606
was much longer
and more involved than he's claimed.

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:16.308
also, while Trump might not be exonerated,
it does look like he's

00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:18.611
never going to be held accountable
for associating with Epstein.

00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:21.414
that's even as you're seeing more
and more people continuing to face career

00:11:21.414 --> 00:11:23.816
ending fallout after having their names
appear in the files.

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:26.919
over the weekend, high profile
Hollywood agent Casey Wasserman announced

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:28.120
that he'll be selling his agency

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.157
amid widespread backlash from his ties
to Epstein and Maxwell.

00:11:31.223 --> 00:11:33.359
And they're coming after major clients
like chaperon

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:35.561
left the agency
following the initial revelations.

00:11:35.561 --> 00:11:37.997
yesterday you had la mayor Karen Bass
calling on Wasserman

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:40.666
to resign from his post
as chairman of the 2028 Olympics.

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:41.834
also yesterday you had Thomas J.

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:44.603
Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt
hotels fortune and cousin,

00:11:44.603 --> 00:11:46.572
a Illinois
governor, JB Pritzker, announcing

00:11:46.572 --> 00:11:49.608
that he stepped down as executive chairman
of the Hyatt Hotels Corporation.

00:11:49.675 --> 00:11:51.477
that coming
after the latest number files revealed

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:53.979
that Pritzker was in regular contact
with Epstein in the years

00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:56.949
after he accepted a plea deal on sex crime
charges in 2008.

00:11:56.949 --> 00:12:00.119
also last Friday, Columbia University said
that it punished two people affiliated

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:01.087
with its dental college

00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:03.489
after documents revealed
that they helped Epstein's girlfriend

00:12:03.489 --> 00:12:05.691
gain admission
outside the normal application process.

00:12:05.691 --> 00:12:06.092
with the school

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:08.060
cutting ties entirely with one person
and stripped

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.296
another of their administrative duties
at the dental college.

00:12:10.296 --> 00:12:11.797
and so with all this, you know,
you have some saying

00:12:11.797 --> 00:12:14.467
while it's a good thing that at least
some people are being held accountable,

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:17.903
it makes it even more infuriating
that Trump and other top officials,

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:19.772
they're not experiencing really
any consequences.

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:20.072
that's even

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:23.142
when their ties go just as deep,
if not deeper than some of these people.

00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:25.611
you know, with all that said,
obviously this is going to be a story

00:12:25.611 --> 00:12:28.247
that we keep covering and covering
and keep our eyes on.

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:30.750
new revelations seem to come
out of the files every single day.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.618
We have things
like the New Mexico investigation

00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:35.020
that isn't going to have interim findings
until July.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.690
There are a lot of moving pieces.
There are a lot of things that matter.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.325
And I'm
going to try and keep you in the loop.

00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:41.494
and then there's more we get to dive
in. Do in just a minute.

00:12:41.494 --> 00:12:43.596
But first,
let me thank a sponsor and say, you know,

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.831
nobody warns you
that adulthood is just deciding

00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:48.267
what's for dinner
every single day, forever.

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:48.934
that exhaustion.

00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:51.303
It's why today's sponsor, HelloFresh,
it stays in my life.

00:12:51.303 --> 00:12:52.371
It removes the hardest part.

00:12:52.371 --> 00:12:54.974
The planning, the portions, the.
What are we even making debate?

00:12:54.974 --> 00:12:56.675
Everything shows up pre-portioned
and ready to cook.

00:12:56.675 --> 00:12:59.211
So dinner feels manageable
instead of mentally draining.

00:12:59.211 --> 00:12:59.745
and honestly,

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:02.782
the meals look and tastes like you tried
way harder than you actually did.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:05.951
HelloFresh has 100 plus recipes every week
comfort food,

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:09.221
global flavors, quick meals,
even I'm pretending to be healthy today.

00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:09.755
Options.

00:13:09.755 --> 00:13:12.892
if you're trying to eat better,
they've got 35 plus high protein recipes

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:15.060
plus Mediterranean
and other friendly choices.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:15.795
also the ingredients.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:16.896
They're legit, sustainably

00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:20.199
sourced seafood and 100%
antibiotic and hormone free chicken. And.

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:21.133
Yeah, the good stuff's here.

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:23.502
Steak and triple
the seafood choices at no extra cost.

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:26.005
Portions are generous, too.
Nobody's quietly raiding the snack drawer.

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:28.174
An hour later.
and for me, it's stress relief.

00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:29.108
No decision fatigue,

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:31.610
no surrendering to take out again,
it's the rare life upgrade

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.379
that actually makes my daily routines
easier.

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:37.383
hey, just go to hellofresh.com/defranco
ten FM and scan the QR

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:40.986
code to get ten free meals, plus a free
Zwilling knife on your third box.

00:13:40.986 --> 00:13:42.388

00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:44.423
Free meals
applied as discount on first box.

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:46.158
New subscribers only. Varies by plan.

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:47.793
but then diving back into the news.

00:13:47.793 --> 00:13:51.530
Are Muslims coming for your dogs
or is Congressman Randy fine just a sick,

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.098
disgusting bigot? spoiler.

00:13:53.098 --> 00:13:53.833
It's a second

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:56.468
but we still have to talk about
why you have people saying this, including

00:13:56.468 --> 00:14:00.406
his bogus claim that an Islam inspired
dog ban is on its way to New York City.

00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:02.741
which should be crystal
clear here isn't even remotely true.

00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:03.375
And it's really

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:06.512
just the latest example of Republicans
spreading lies about Muslims in the U.S.

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:09.114
in order to score political points,
especially in Texas.

00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:09.715
but starting with fine.

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:12.685
Who represents the great state
or flaccid dick of America? Florida.

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:14.153
You are sparking outrage this week.

00:14:14.153 --> 00:14:16.522
And when he wrote on X,
they force us to choose, the choice

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.791
between dogs and Muslims
is not a difficult one.

00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:21.293
with him, then saying in a follow up pose
that his statement was a response

00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:22.494
to another post from someone

00:14:22.494 --> 00:14:25.598
that he described as the leader
of one of the key mainstream Muslim groups

00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:27.633
that supported New York City
Mayor Zoran Mamdani,

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:30.102
which said, finally, NYC
is coming to Islam.

00:14:30.102 --> 00:14:33.539
Dogs definitely have a place in society,
just not as indoor pets.

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.474
Like we've said all along,
they are unclean.

00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:37.676
And that person is Nadine Kisangani.

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:40.346
she's the founder of one of New York's
major pro-Palestinian groups.

00:14:40.346 --> 00:14:42.414
She's actually
criticized Mamdani several times.

00:14:42.414 --> 00:14:44.683
And she has zero role
in his administration.

00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:46.285
and actually, in addition to all that,

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:48.320
according to her and many
who read what she wrote,

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.822
she wasn't being at all serious,

00:14:49.822 --> 00:14:51.624
her explaining
after the post started picking up steam.

00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:53.926
It's obviously a joke.
I don't care if you have a dog.

00:14:53.926 --> 00:14:56.695
I do care if your dog is shitting
everywhere and you're not cleaning it.

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:59.465
Britain, that's actually an ongoing point
of conversation in the city right now.

00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:01.400
number of complaints about dog waste
not being picked up in

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.235
the city
has reportedly increased over the years.

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:05.004
in fact,
just a few days ago, before all of this,

00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:08.407
you even had the New York Post publishing
an article about New Yorkers being forced

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:12.344
to dodge minefields of UN scoop dog poop
littering weeks old sidewalks. No.

00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:12.811
with Carson.

00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:15.981
He also later telling NBC news
that her original comment was satire,

00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:18.217
based on a hyperlocal New York City
conversation

00:15:18.217 --> 00:15:21.353
about dog waste in the city, and adding
she was satirizing Islamophobic

00:15:21.353 --> 00:15:24.757
hysteria, portraying Mom
Donnie's mayoralty as a societal takeover.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.825
then with all this, you had her online
saying that she's received

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:29.795
death threats and also highlighting
what she sees as hypocrisy. Right.

00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:32.398
And Kristi Noem literally bragged
about shooting her own dog.

00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:34.433
And most of you did not bat an eyelash.

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:37.836
adding in a separate post that 97% of
Gaza's animal life has been wiped out.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:38.637
actually looking into it.

00:15:38.637 --> 00:15:41.206
That number comes from an advocacy group
and it refers specifically

00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:43.609
to the territories
animal well, such as livestock.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:44.410
you know, in any case,

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.812
while all of that context matters,
you know, many have argued that

00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:49.014
whatever it is,
he said, there's no context

00:15:49.014 --> 00:15:51.417
that would have made comparing dogs
to Muslims. Okay.

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:52.384
and so you had people like New York

00:15:52.384 --> 00:15:55.387
Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
writing on X.

00:15:55.421 --> 00:15:57.456
is genuinely
one of the most disgusting statements

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:59.391
I have ever seen
issued by an American official.

00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:00.626
it should not stop shocking us

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:03.996
that the Republican Party openly embraces
this fine, should be censured

00:16:03.996 --> 00:16:07.232
and stripped of committees to ignore
this is to accept and normalize it.

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:09.668
you know, representative O'Connor
hitting kind of a similar statement

00:16:09.668 --> 00:16:12.871
saying we must call this what it is
disgusting bigotry.

00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:13.973
Fine. Must be censured.

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.542
It's about morality and decency,
not politics.

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:19.178
And that is, you had others keeping it
kind of short and sweet. California

00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:22.247
Governor Gavin Newsom urged fine to resign
and called him a racist slob.

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:23.716
you even had conservative
commentator Piers

00:16:23.716 --> 00:16:25.884
Morgan slamming
vine as a disgusting prick.

00:16:25.884 --> 00:16:27.753
but also you have many saying
this isn't the first time

00:16:27.753 --> 00:16:30.456
that Randy fine has said something
that should make him lose his job.

00:16:30.456 --> 00:16:31.590
that actually included Carson,

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.560
who told NBC that he had a documented
pattern of dehumanizing

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.463
Palestinians and Muslims and adding,
there has been a troubling pattern

00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:40.899
in which anti-Muslim and Anti-palestinian
rhetoric from elected officials

00:16:40.899 --> 00:16:42.901
has not been met
with the level of accountability

00:16:42.901 --> 00:16:45.938
we would expect if almost any other
community were discussed this way.

00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:48.374
with that, you also had the Council
on American-Islamic relations

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:51.143
noting that it's already calling
for fines, resignation after he suggested

00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:53.779
that you can't make peace
with, quote, mainstream Muslims.

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:55.180
And you have to destroy them first.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.750
but with all that, as far as fine, he's
shown zero remorse.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.685
And in fact,
he's only doubled and tripled down, right.

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:02.154
He actually expanded his claims
about who made the original post

00:17:02.154 --> 00:17:05.391
from someone in charge of an organization
that supported Mamdani to a major

00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:08.494
new York City
Muslim leader and a key Mamdani advisor.

00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:11.430
then on a Newsmax interview, you had him
somehow making the leap to a dog ban

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:14.033
being something that Democrats,
including AOC, are pushing for.

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:15.367
It's not enough for Democrats

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:19.271
to think anyone who wants to come here
illegally should be able to do that.

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:22.541
They also think they should be able
to get whatever free stuff they want.

00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:27.646
Now they're demanding that we change
our values and how we live as Americans.

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:33.085
My post was in response to a major Muslim
leader saying dogs should be forbidden

00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:37.389
from New York City
because to some Muslims it bothers them.

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:40.492
Well, if they're going to make us choose
between our dogs

00:17:40.492 --> 00:17:44.530
and them going home, the choice is easy
and people should know.

00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:49.835
Democrats like AOC are saying,
we are going to get rid of your dogs.

00:17:49.935 --> 00:17:53.238
Americans need to keep that in mind
when they go to vote in November.

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:55.808
just lie after lie after bigoted lie.

00:17:55.808 --> 00:17:57.476
Because of course the Democrats don't.

00:17:57.476 --> 00:17:59.611
Because no one,
and especially no one in power

00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:02.147
is trying to get rid of dogs
in New York City, just like

00:18:02.147 --> 00:18:04.583
no one is seriously trying to implement
Sharia law in Texas.

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:05.484
But still, Republican

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:09.388
lawmakers from there have created a Sharia
free American caucus in Congress.

00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:11.657
actually the state Senate
there is currently weighing legislation

00:18:11.657 --> 00:18:14.593
requested by Lieutenant Governor Dan
Patrick to ensure Texans, quote,

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:16.962
are never held
under the heel of Sharia law.

00:18:16.962 --> 00:18:19.031
you know, with all that
this type of anti-Muslim

00:18:19.031 --> 00:18:20.699
rhetoric that we've seen from vine,
it's become

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:23.102
especially common in Texas
with the elections coming up. right.

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:26.038
Valentina Gomez,
she launched her candidacy in Texass 31st

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:27.706
Congressional district
last year with a video

00:18:27.706 --> 00:18:30.909
showing her burning a Koran and declaring
that your daughters will be raped

00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:33.712
and your sons beheaded
unless we stop Islam once and for all.

00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:36.281
also Texas Senator John Cornyn. He's
currently up for reelection.

00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:37.716
And he recently launched a seven figure

00:18:37.716 --> 00:18:41.120
ad by declaring radical Islam
a bloodthirsty ideology.

00:18:41.186 --> 00:18:43.455
And then you have people like Larry Brock
and Air Force Vad,

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:46.592
who served two years in prison
for entering the US Capitol on Jan six.

00:18:46.592 --> 00:18:48.794
And he's currently running for a seat
in the state legislature.

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:52.564
And he's calling for banning the hijab,
Hilal meat and the celebration of Ramadan.

00:18:52.564 --> 00:18:52.664
Right.

00:18:52.664 --> 00:18:54.766
That also notably several ads
from different candidates

00:18:54.766 --> 00:18:58.036
in the state of news footage from a place
called the East Plano Islamic Center,

00:18:58.036 --> 00:19:00.572
where just this weekend,
Muslims were harassed while praying.

00:19:00.572 --> 00:19:02.107
and we know that you have many saying
that they're

00:19:02.107 --> 00:19:04.610
now increasingly living in fear,
but also notably. Right.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:05.477
All this attention,

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:09.414
is despite the fact that the Muslims there
make up 2% of the population.

00:19:09.414 --> 00:19:12.384
it's actually a lot of the anti-Muslim
sentiment is believed to have originated

00:19:12.384 --> 00:19:14.553
out of the suburbs of Dallas
and Fort Worth, because that's

00:19:14.553 --> 00:19:16.555
where the number of Muslim residents
is really grown

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:19.057
significantly in recent decades,
along with the number of mosques.

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:20.125
and with this, you have many arguing

00:19:20.125 --> 00:19:23.529
that this focus on Muslims, it's
the new way to motivate Republican voters

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:25.964
now that the border crossings
have all but come to a stop.

00:19:25.964 --> 00:19:28.033
Or even at a top strategist for Governor
Greg Abbott

00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:31.036
telling the New York Times,
any event you go to, people ask about it.

00:19:31.036 --> 00:19:33.739
It's like the border used to be.
what are you doing about Sharia law?

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:35.974
What are you doing about the Muslims
taking over the state?

00:19:35.974 --> 00:19:38.177
you had a consultant for the Texas
GOP telling Politico

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:40.512
the Muslim community is the boogeyman
for this cycle.

00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:42.181
100%. This message works.

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:43.949
There's no question about
has been pulled up

00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:46.985
one side and down the other end with Texas
Republican primary voters.

00:19:46.985 --> 00:19:49.688
It works. It is the thing
they are legitimately scared of.

00:19:49.688 --> 00:19:52.591
and it was these last statement that I
think we, we really need to absorb Right.

00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:54.159
Because these people, people like Randy.

00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:57.095
Fine, he didn't accidentally say something
offensive and apologize.

00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:59.932
This bigotry is a coordinated campaign
strategy.

00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:01.567
truth
doesn't matter to so many of these people.

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:03.302
They got called out for lying,

00:20:03.302 --> 00:20:07.005
for being bigoted liars,
and they just escalated the rhetoric.

00:20:07.072 --> 00:20:07.539
Randy. Fine.

00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:10.342
Yes. He is an exceptional douchebag,
a waste of space.

00:20:10.342 --> 00:20:12.911
But he is also not an outlier.
He is part of a pattern.

00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:14.479
They go after these small groups of people

00:20:14.479 --> 00:20:17.115
that they want you to see
as just so different from you.

00:20:17.115 --> 00:20:19.151
And, you know, so many cultures
are different from one another.

00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:21.086
but they are trying
to make the Muslim community a boogeyman.

00:20:21.086 --> 00:20:22.788
And so I think it's very important
to remember that

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:25.958
these are people that are your neighbors,
your coworkers, your community members,

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:27.025
not boogeyman.

00:20:27.025 --> 00:20:29.194
it's just another way for them
to make people fearful

00:20:29.194 --> 00:20:32.364
and angry and fight left
versus right, rather than having the time

00:20:32.364 --> 00:20:35.634
and the ability to look up and see
who's really pulling the puppet strings.

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:36.735
as far as when, you know, people ask,

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:38.971
what is it that I can actually do to
then help?

00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:41.506
you can do things like call out the lies
when you see them.

00:20:41.506 --> 00:20:42.808
If you want to do something in person.

00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:44.142
They're interfaith events.

00:20:44.142 --> 00:20:46.144
or because what a lot of these scumbags
don't want you to realize

00:20:46.144 --> 00:20:48.547
is you have so much more in common
with one another,

00:20:48.547 --> 00:20:51.250
despite different cultures
than you have with the elites.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.452
we are cattle in their eyes.
Don't forget that.

00:20:53.452 --> 00:20:55.420
and then there's more
we're going to dive into in just a minute.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.122
But first,
let me thank the sponsor and say

00:20:57.122 --> 00:20:59.891
my brain seems to have two modes, either
hyper focus

00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:02.494
or why am I reorganizing my desk
when I should be working?

00:21:02.494 --> 00:21:05.330
that's why I use
and I love today's sponsor, brain FM.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:06.064
it's not just music.

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:06.665
It's audio

00:21:06.665 --> 00:21:10.469
designed by scientists to help you brain
lock into focus, relaxation or sleep.

00:21:10.469 --> 00:21:11.336
before brain FM.

00:21:11.336 --> 00:21:14.206
I throw on random playlists
and somehow end up more distracted

00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:16.308
than when I started their tracks,
they're built differently,

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:19.344
using science backed sound patterns
that help your brain stay on task.

00:21:19.378 --> 00:21:21.046
I put it on,
it's like the background noise

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:24.082
in my head dials down from chaos to, okay,
we can work with this.

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:24.850
they've got modes for

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.787
deep work, creativity, relaxation,
and even an ADHD specific mode.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:29.521
it's dead simple.

00:21:29.521 --> 00:21:31.823
Open the app, pick
what you need, hit play done.

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:34.326
I use it anytime my brain starts
acting like it left the stove on.

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:35.460
also a fun fact, brain

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.664
FM is actually the only music app
supported by a National Science Foundation

00:21:38.664 --> 00:21:39.731
grant to study focus.

00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:41.733
so saying concentrate,
it feels harder than it should.

00:21:41.733 --> 00:21:43.168
This is absolutely worth trying.

00:21:50.776 --> 00:21:52.177
then diving back into the news. Right.

00:21:52.177 --> 00:21:53.745
The final story of the day today,

00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:55.614
we've got to talk about
what many are calling

00:21:55.614 --> 00:21:58.450
the unofficial primary for the Democratic
presidential nomination.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:21:59.151
it actually went down

00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:02.220
not in DC, not in any swing state,
but rather in Germany

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.722
at the Munich Security Conference.

00:22:03.722 --> 00:22:06.558
because three Democrats
who were widely seen as potential 20, 28

00:22:06.558 --> 00:22:08.627
frontrunners hopped on planes
and they flew over there

00:22:08.627 --> 00:22:10.729
to provide some opposition at the summit,
where the U.S.

00:22:10.729 --> 00:22:12.564
was otherwise represented by Marco Rubio.

00:22:12.564 --> 00:22:15.033
And also, don't worry, we will get
to the crazy shit that he said.

00:22:15.033 --> 00:22:16.601
But first,
we've got to talk about these Democrats,

00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:19.371
starting with Gavin Newsom
attacking Trump on climate policy.

00:22:19.371 --> 00:22:25.043
I hope if there's nothing else I can communicate today, Donald Trump is temporary.

00:22:26.378 --> 00:22:28.447
He'll be gone in three years.

00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:32.684
California is a stable
and reliable partner in this space.

00:22:32.818 --> 00:22:34.686
then you had Michigan's governor,
Gretchen Whitmer,

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:37.122
who got a lot of flak for this
answer to a question about what

00:22:37.122 --> 00:22:38.523
victory would look like for Ukraine.

00:22:38.523 --> 00:22:40.092
It is. I.

00:22:40.092 --> 00:22:40.759
The two.

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:44.696
The two that I am on the panel with
are much more steeped in foreign policy

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:46.198
than us, than a governor is.

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:49.201
But, you know, I do think that

00:22:49.768 --> 00:22:54.005
Ukraine's independence
keeping their their land mass on having,

00:22:54.106 --> 00:22:58.009
the support of of all the allies,
I think is

00:22:58.443 --> 00:23:00.512
is the goal with that,
you had some saying that it's weird

00:23:00.512 --> 00:23:02.280
that she's on a panel
talking about foreign policy.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.783
If she claims
not to know much about foreign policy,

00:23:04.783 --> 00:23:06.518
but that also brings us
to one of the other panelists

00:23:06.518 --> 00:23:08.820
that you pointed to as being more steeped
in the subject.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.489
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. right.

00:23:10.489 --> 00:23:13.158
Because when she spoke,
everyone listened very intently. Right.

00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:14.993
I mean, she's typically focused
on domestic issues,

00:23:14.993 --> 00:23:17.496
and this was the most prominent
foreign trip for her to date.

00:23:17.496 --> 00:23:19.498
plenty of people saying, you know,
she's going to be running for president,

00:23:19.498 --> 00:23:21.600
which is not confirmed yet,
then it is important

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.335
to hear her philosophy on world affairs.

00:23:23.335 --> 00:23:25.670
generally her international message
mirrored her domestic one.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.873
Right, that the United States
needs to cooperate with allies

00:23:27.873 --> 00:23:31.510
to tamp down inequality, lift up
the global working class and combat far

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:32.644
right authoritarianism.

00:23:32.644 --> 00:23:36.481
with her also favoring diplomacy with Iran
and saying that unconditional aid Israel

00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:37.916
has enabled a genocide in Gaza.

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:39.284
but then also with this,
you saw Republicans

00:23:39.284 --> 00:23:41.753
seizing on a few specific moments
where she seemed to stumble,

00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:42.888
and they try to use that as evidence

00:23:42.888 --> 00:23:46.124
that she and the Democrats more broadly,
are unserious about foreign policy.

00:23:46.124 --> 00:23:47.926
and so, for example,
when she was asked about whether the U.S.

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:50.562
should commit troops to defending Taiwan
if China moves against it,

00:23:50.562 --> 00:23:53.965
she appeared to kind of fumble
for a good 20s before giving a non-answer.

00:23:53.965 --> 00:23:54.933
You know,

00:23:55.967 --> 00:23:59.070
I think that, this is

00:23:59.538 --> 00:24:02.607
such a, you know, I think that

00:24:03.975 --> 00:24:06.978
this is a,

00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:07.813
This is,

00:24:07.813 --> 00:24:11.149
of course, a, a very long standing,

00:24:12.184 --> 00:24:14.653
policy of the United States.

00:24:14.653 --> 00:24:18.890
And I think what we are hoping for
is that we want to make sure that we never

00:24:19.591 --> 00:24:22.694
get to that point,
and we want to make sure

00:24:22.694 --> 00:24:27.132
that we are moving
in all of our economic research

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:31.336
and our global positions
to avoid any such confrontation.

00:24:31.336 --> 00:24:33.438
And for that question
to even arise, answer with this,

00:24:33.438 --> 00:24:35.106
you had people pointing to another point
where

00:24:35.106 --> 00:24:37.342
instead of saying
Trans Atlantic Partnership, she said.

00:24:37.342 --> 00:24:39.044
Trans Pacific Partnership.

00:24:39.044 --> 00:24:41.313
they was later acknowledging that
that was just a mistake.

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:43.482
And then lastly, during a question
about Venezuelan

00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:46.318
President Nicolas Maduro,
she said. He canceled elections.

00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:47.819
He was an anti-democratic leader.

00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:52.824
That doesn't mean that we can kidnap
a head of state and engage

00:24:52.824 --> 00:24:56.394
in acts of war, just because the nation is
below the equator writing.

00:24:56.394 --> 00:24:58.530
For context,
Venezuela is just above the equator.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.732
and so with all that you, with people
and the right kind of having a field

00:25:00.732 --> 00:25:04.603
with his mocking or as stupid, clueless,
uninformed and Trump joined in as well.

00:25:04.603 --> 00:25:07.873
I watched AOC
answering questions in Munich.

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:10.542
This was not a good look
with the United States.

00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:11.877
they started answering questions.

00:25:11.877 --> 00:25:13.578
She had no idea what was happening.

00:25:13.578 --> 00:25:15.547
She had no idea how to answer,

00:25:15.547 --> 00:25:19.017
you know, very important questions
concerning the world.

00:25:19.117 --> 00:25:20.919
which I got to say that that's insane.

00:25:20.919 --> 00:25:23.855
Coming from a one man
whose entire shtick is calling reporters

00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:25.991
fake news when they ask questions
that he doesn't like.

00:25:25.991 --> 00:25:28.760
And two,
the man is a fucking gaffe machine.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.462
Among other things, he's
the guy who apparently thought

00:25:30.462 --> 00:25:32.631
that he was about to board
a plane to Russia to meet Putin.

00:25:32.631 --> 00:25:33.665
It was actually Alaska.

00:25:33.665 --> 00:25:37.102
And he repeatedly mistook Greenland,
the territory he wants to fucking invade,

00:25:37.102 --> 00:25:39.204
because he didn't get the Nobel Prize
for Iceland.

00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:41.907
personally, I will say one of my favorites
is that time that he said George

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:45.310
Washington's army took control of airports
during the Revolutionary War.

00:25:45.377 --> 00:25:46.878
It took over the airports.

00:25:46.878 --> 00:25:48.680
It did everything it had to do.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.047
but anyway,

00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:50.815
you had AOC actually
telling the New York Times

00:25:50.815 --> 00:25:51.650
that she was frustrated

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:54.753
by the way, that her performance at Munich
was microscopically dissected

00:25:54.753 --> 00:25:55.754
through the lens of what it meant

00:25:55.754 --> 00:25:57.455
for a hypothetical white House
campaign. writing

00:25:57.455 --> 00:26:00.058
this reporter came up to me and was like,
Is Munich, the new New Hampshire?

00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:02.994
I cannot say enough how out of touch
and missing the point, genuinely,

00:26:02.994 --> 00:26:06.298
that is, global democracies are on fire
the world over, and established parties

00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:09.301
are falling to right wing populist
movements, adding that she went to Munich.

00:26:09.301 --> 00:26:11.536
Not because I'm running for president,
not because I've made

00:26:11.536 --> 00:26:13.805
some kind of decision
about a horse race or a candidacy,

00:26:13.805 --> 00:26:15.840
but because we need to sound
the alarm bells

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:16.608
at a lot of these folks

00:26:16.608 --> 00:26:19.678
in nicely pressed suits in that room
will not be there much longer

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:22.080
if we do not do something
about the runaway inequality

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.015
that is fueling far right
populist movements.

00:26:24.015 --> 00:26:26.885
When you add AOC saying that argument
was well received by the Europeans,

00:26:26.885 --> 00:26:28.954
including the German leaders,
that she privately met with.

00:26:28.954 --> 00:26:31.156
but also she did
participate in the viral clip drama

00:26:31.156 --> 00:26:33.124
at least a little bit
because she took this shot

00:26:33.124 --> 00:26:35.427
at Trump Secretary of State
Marco Rubio for this claim.

00:26:35.427 --> 00:26:40.332
Our horses, our ranches, our rodeos, the
the entire romance of the cowboy

00:26:40.332 --> 00:26:43.668
archetype that became synonymous
with the American West.

00:26:45.003 --> 00:26:45.570
These were born in

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:48.873
Spain, and without you, a AOC leader
calling that out in the same conference.

00:26:48.873 --> 00:26:53.044
My favorite part was when he said that,
American cowboys

00:26:53.044 --> 00:26:56.047
came from Spain.

00:26:56.047 --> 00:26:57.515
I thought that way, too.

00:26:57.515 --> 00:27:02.253
But I believe the Mexicans and descendants
of, of African slave

00:27:02.287 --> 00:27:06.658
enslaved peoples, 
would like to have a word, on that.

00:27:06.658 --> 00:27:07.559
now that that of course, it

00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:10.762
sparked this heated debate online
about where cowboys actually come from.

00:27:10.762 --> 00:27:12.163
there were also like,
if you looked online,

00:27:12.163 --> 00:27:13.465
you could tell
it was like one of those debates

00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:16.001
where all of a sudden
everyone was like a cowboy expert.

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:17.268
for a lot of it, it became very clear

00:27:17.268 --> 00:27:19.337
that it's about something
much, much deeper, yeah.

00:27:19.337 --> 00:27:21.206
Those on the right pointing out the
the Spanish had a long

00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:23.775
tradition of horsemanship,
which they brought to the Americas. Right.

00:27:23.775 --> 00:27:25.910
The earliest American cowboys
were the vaqueros,

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:27.846
with vacca being Spanish for cow.

00:27:27.846 --> 00:27:30.248
And even though lasso,
coming from the Spanish word for rope.

00:27:30.248 --> 00:27:32.851
and Ted Cruz
declaring victory over wokeness writing it

00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:34.819
AOC me you know nothing about history

00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:36.688
without saying you know
nothing about history.

00:27:36.688 --> 00:27:39.024
but also, Ted, you should hold out
because it turns out

00:27:39.024 --> 00:27:41.059
that the actual history, it's a bit
more complicated.

00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:43.294
does the History Channel notes
first trained by the Spaniards,

00:27:43.294 --> 00:27:46.064
who arrived in 1519 on land
later known as Mexico.

00:27:46.064 --> 00:27:49.401
The original vaqueros
were largely indigenous Mesoamerican men

00:27:49.401 --> 00:27:51.436
who were trained
to wrangle cattle on horseback.

00:27:51.436 --> 00:27:53.838
also the vaqueros
weren't just horsemen in the Spanish mold.

00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:55.640
They developed their own
distinctive culture.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.474
built their own saddles.

00:27:56.474 --> 00:27:58.810
They braided their own rope,
invented their distinctive shapes.

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:01.413
They tamed wild horses
and mastered the signature lasso.

00:28:01.413 --> 00:28:01.746
plus you,

00:28:01.746 --> 00:28:02.247
the historians

00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:05.350
estimating that by the 19th century,
as many as a quarter of all

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.317
cowboys were black.

00:28:06.317 --> 00:28:08.787
it was only with the Hollywood westerns
of the early 20th century

00:28:08.787 --> 00:28:11.156
that cowboys were seen as heroic
white Americans,

00:28:11.156 --> 00:28:14.159
rather than the multiracial groups
that actually developed the practice.

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:16.528
also like with AOC,
I don't want this one moment

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:19.564
to completely overshadow everything else
that Marco Rubio said in his speech.

00:28:19.564 --> 00:28:21.266
because on the one hand,
he took a much friendlier,

00:28:21.266 --> 00:28:22.333
more cooperative posture

00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:25.704
toward Europe than Trump and Vance have,
which gave many there some reassurance.

00:28:25.704 --> 00:28:27.505
but on the other hand,
that the common ground that he found

00:28:27.505 --> 00:28:29.808
between America and Europe,
it was a little abstract.

00:28:29.808 --> 00:28:32.143
And to many
it sounded like a dog whistle for race.

00:28:32.143 --> 00:28:36.014
We are part of one civilization,
Western civilization.

00:28:36.648 --> 00:28:39.117
We are bound to one another
by the deepest bonds

00:28:39.117 --> 00:28:42.954
that nations could share,
forged by centuries of shared history,

00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:47.992
Christian faith, culture, heritage,
language, ancestry,

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.696
and the sacrifices
our forefathers made together

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:55.300
We are connected spiritually,
and we are connected culturally.

00:28:55.366 --> 00:28:58.536
we should note here that, scholars debate
whether the concept of Western

00:28:58.536 --> 00:29:01.139
civilization
is even useful or historically tenable.

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:03.775
but even putting it aside,
many of the things that Rubio thinks bind

00:29:03.775 --> 00:29:07.078
the West together
language, culture, religion, ancestry,

00:29:07.078 --> 00:29:10.615
they are precisely things that tore Europe
apart and bloody wars for centuries. it.

00:29:10.648 --> 00:29:13.284
Rubio cast
all of Europe as one unified civilization

00:29:13.284 --> 00:29:15.553
that single handedly made
the United States what it is.

00:29:15.553 --> 00:29:18.123
with them lumping together
Christopher Columbus, English settlers,

00:29:18.123 --> 00:29:20.959
Scots-Irish frontiersmen,
German farmers and craftsmen

00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:24.028
and French fur traders and explorers
and, of course, Spanish cowboys.

00:29:24.028 --> 00:29:24.929
meanwhile, many noting

00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:28.032
he made no mention of any contribution
by non-European peoples,

00:29:28.032 --> 00:29:31.069
no mention of the slaves who pick the cod,
no mention to the Chinese

00:29:31.069 --> 00:29:33.738
who built the railroads, nothing about
the Mexicans who labored on farms.

00:29:33.738 --> 00:29:36.474
And that's just kind of naming
a few of the many, many examples.

00:29:36.474 --> 00:29:37.976
in fact,
the only times that Rubio mentioned

00:29:37.976 --> 00:29:40.378
nonwhite people,
it was to paint them as dangerous threats.

00:29:40.378 --> 00:29:42.714
with them claiming
that mass migration is destabilizing

00:29:42.714 --> 00:29:45.016
Western societies,
disrupting cultural cohesion,

00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:47.652
and threatening the future
of what he called our people.

00:29:47.652 --> 00:29:50.121
apparently doesn't care
when that migration goes the other way

00:29:50.121 --> 00:29:51.790
because he wax nostalgic about

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.959
how for five centuries, the West did sent
missionaries, pilgrims, soldiers

00:29:54.959 --> 00:29:58.863
and explorers across oceans to build vast
empires, but only stopped expanding

00:29:58.863 --> 00:29:59.764
after World War II. Two.

00:29:59.764 --> 00:30:02.767
The great Western empires
had entered into terminal decline,

00:30:03.301 --> 00:30:06.304
accelerated
by godless communist revolutions

00:30:06.437 --> 00:30:09.474
and by anti-colonial uprisings
but as others have pointed out,

00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:11.409
that seems to fly in the face
of his earlier argument,

00:30:11.409 --> 00:30:14.145
because the five centuries
that he wants to go back to was a time

00:30:14.145 --> 00:30:16.314
when Europeans were almost constantly
killing each other,

00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:17.982
in fact,
the postwar period that he doesn't like,

00:30:17.982 --> 00:30:21.152
it was one of the most stable and peaceful
periods in trans-Atlantic history.

00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:21.486
But anyway.

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:24.122
Right, with all of this,
you had Rubio saying that just as leaders

00:30:24.122 --> 00:30:28.092
refused to allow the decline of Western
dominance in centuries past, Donald Trump

00:30:28.092 --> 00:30:30.995
and the United States want to do that
again, together with Europe.

00:30:30.995 --> 00:30:34.465
This is why we do not want our allies
to be shackled by guilt and shame.

00:30:34.866 --> 00:30:37.302
We want allies
who are proud of their culture

00:30:37.302 --> 00:30:41.072
and of their heritage, who understand
that we are heirs to the same great

00:30:41.072 --> 00:30:44.642
and noble civilization, so, with all that
said, just to give my opinion here.

00:30:44.642 --> 00:30:47.545
think the few gaffes aside, it
is important to, to really boil this down.

00:30:47.545 --> 00:30:50.682
AOC message was about inequality
fueling far right movements.

00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:53.985
The need for diplomacy, the opposition
to unconditional military aid.

00:30:53.985 --> 00:30:54.652
Rubio's message

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:58.122
was about restoring Western dominance,
lamenting the end of colonialism

00:30:58.122 --> 00:31:01.125
and framing nonwhite migration
as a threat to our people.

00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:03.294
but because AOC fumbled the Taiwan
question

00:31:03.294 --> 00:31:05.663
and mispronounce
one word Republicans, including Trump,

00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:08.933
the man who thinks that George Washington
captured fucking airports,

00:31:08.933 --> 00:31:11.836
seized on to it as proof that Democrats
don't understand foreign policy.

00:31:11.836 --> 00:31:14.873
Meanwhile, Rubio explicitly said
anti-colonial uprisings were bad,

00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:17.075
praised five centuries of empire
building and argued

00:31:17.075 --> 00:31:20.445
that we need to stop being shackled
by guilt and shame about Western history.

00:31:20.511 --> 00:31:23.948
AOC said that she went to Munich to sound
the alarm about inequality fueling far

00:31:23.948 --> 00:31:27.218
right movements, she's describing
exactly what Rubio speech represents.

00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:29.187
He's not offering solutions
to global problems.

00:31:29.187 --> 00:31:32.090
He's offering white Western identity.
Politics is foreign policy.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:33.024
the fact that mainstream coverage

00:31:33.024 --> 00:31:36.661
is treating these two performances
as equivalent is journalistic malpractice.

00:31:36.661 --> 00:31:39.097
But hey, again. And as always,
this is a Philip DeFranco show.

00:31:39.097 --> 00:31:41.199
You get the news, my opinion,
and whether you agree

00:31:41.199 --> 00:31:43.401
or you disagree with me, let me know what
you're thinking in those comments.

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:45.870
Whether it be this story or anything else
we talk about.

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:47.605
hey, that my friends,
you beautiful bastards,

00:31:47.605 --> 00:31:49.974
is where your Tuesday
Philip DeFranco show is going to end.

00:31:49.974 --> 00:31:51.476
And. Well, of course I love your faces.

00:31:51.476 --> 00:31:54.312
And of course, I'll see you right
back here tomorrow to dive into more news.

00:31:54.312 --> 00:31:55.246
You've got even more.

00:31:55.246 --> 00:31:57.582
Just a click away,
because you can check out that do podcast

00:31:57.582 --> 00:31:59.684
and interview
I did with Adam Freedland right here.

00:31:59.684 --> 00:32:02.453
Or you can check out last night's Philip
DeFranco show that you might have missed.
