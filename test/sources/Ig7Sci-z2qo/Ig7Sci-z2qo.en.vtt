00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.835
Sup, you beautiful bastards.

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:03.603
Welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show.

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:06.706
It is Friday, which means you're getting
a very special edition of the show.

00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:08.308
It is from the bastards.

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:10.643
So what that means
is that you have control.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:12.979
You'll see it in questions or topics
you want us to break down,

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:15.915
and we do our Philip DeFranco
show thing and get it out to you.

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:19.152
So hey, hit that like button and let's
dive into our first question and topic.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:22.155
And first up today we've got Nick, who's
actually worked as a teacher in Dallas

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:25.291
asking a question I think a lot of parents
are genuinely wrestling with right now.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:25.825
For the past

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:29.496
ten years, the education system doesn't
seem what it used to be back in the day.

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:33.733
It's kind of scares me to see the way
it's been dissolved

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:39.139
as far as what we're allowed to teach kids
and what we're allowed to allow them

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.672
to learn.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.941
And it's
kind of surprising to me as a parent,

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:45.045
would you allow your kids
to go to the public school system

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.312
that they have nowadays?

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:47.714
So this hits close to home for me.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.783
My wife's
even running for the school board here

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:52.052
because we really, really care
about the public school system.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.219
But before I give you my answer,

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.588
let's actually look at the state
of public education in America,

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:57.290
because the data is actually
pretty sobering.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.125
And we'll start
with the most straightforward measure.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.693
Our kids actually learning.

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:02.595
To answer that question,
we need to take a look at results

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:04.531
from National Assessment
of Educational Progress,

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:07.801
which is a series of standardized tests
widely known as the Nation's Report card.

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.903
When you look at the most recent data
from 2024,

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:13.039
it shows that 12th grade reading
and math scores, they've hit record lows.

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.341
Just 35% of high school
seniors were proficient

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:18.745
in reading, 32% scored below
the basic level, and math was even worse.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:23.016
Only 22% of seniors were proficient
in nearly half scored below basic half.

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:25.351
So the gap between the highest and lowest
performing

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:28.455
eighth graders, it's the widest it's ever
been, and experts largely point

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:31.224
to the pandemic as the primary cause.
But it's also not the only one.

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:34.761
Ironic absenteeism, more screen time,
shorter attention spans, and a decline

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.831
in kids reading, longer form
content are all contributing factors.

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:39.732
And here's the thing that makes it worse
the Trump administration

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:43.303
has cut roughly a dozen national and state
student assessments through 2032.

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:46.172
So on top of scores dropping,
we're also going to have less visibility

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:47.540
into how much they're dropping

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.176
and the people inside of the system,
they are not optimistic.

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:54.080
A Pew Research Center report from 2024
found that 82% of teachers said that

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.216
the overall state of public K-12
education,

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:58.184
it has gotten worse in the past
five years.

00:01:58.184 --> 00:01:59.919
More than half
said that they wouldn't advise

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:01.688
a young person
to even enter the profession.

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:05.658
You had a 2025 Gallup poll finding
that 73% of Americans said they were very

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:08.928
or somewhat dissatisfied with the quality
of the US public education system.

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:11.131
Overall, the percentage of adults
who are still satisfied

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:15.068
is the lowest it's ever been since Gallup
started asking the question back in 2001.

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:16.503
Also, about half of all U.S.

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:19.072
adults say public
K-12 is going in the wrong direction.

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:20.840
And then, you know,
there's the curriculum debate,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.875
and that's been its own firestorm.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:25.645
I mean, from 2021 to 2024, nearly one
third of states have banned

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:29.449
K-12 school curricula that offer critical
perspectives on America's racial history.

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:32.685
During that same time period, legislatures
in at least 40 states introduce

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:34.921
more than 200 pieces of legislation
to restrict with.

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:35.755
Teachers can discuss

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:39.092
and actually punish them for teaching
what some call divisive topics.

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:39.859
And supporters argue

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.862
this protects kids from political
indoctrination, but critics argue

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:43.963
it does the opposite that

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:46.666
limiting, complex,
honest conversations about history.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.402
It leaves students with a simplified
and distorted picture of the world.

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:52.038
So with all of that context, you know,
what are families actually doing?

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:54.207
Well, a lot of them, they're leaving
private school enrollment.

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:57.210
It has surged post-pandemic,
with roughly 40% of private schools

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.213
reporting enrollment
increases in the 2023 2024 school year.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:01.014
A big driver of that

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:04.250
has been the expansion of school choice
programs, government funded vouchers

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.020
that let families use taxpayer dollars
to pay for private school.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.321
Right before the pandemic, just over

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.323
half a million
students were using those programs.

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:12.859
And now, I mean, that's above 1.3 million.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.060
You're seeing things like an HOA

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.262
survey finding
that 50% of parents would send their kids

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:18.264
to private school or homeschool
if given the option.

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:21.367
Now, with that, you know, private schools
do consistently outperform public schools

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:23.203
and standardized tests
and college placement.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.338
But researchers are very quick
to add here.

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:26.606
There's important context.

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:27.140
When you control

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.276
for socioeconomic status,
that achievement gap shrinks dramatically.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:32.345
The 2018 analysis found that
a student success

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:35.348
is less about the type of school
they attend, and more about the attributes

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:39.252
of their family parental education
levels, income, access to tutors, having a

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.387
quiet space to study at home,
things like that.

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:44.490
And so essentially, private schools often
look better on paper, partly

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.993
because they serve wealthier students
who are likely going to do

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:47.794
well regardless.

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:49.862
That said,
that the post-pandemic achievement gap

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:51.931
between public and private schools,
they've just grown,

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:54.400
and lower income communities
are bearing the brunt of all of it.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.002
And then,
you know, it can get complicated.

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.638
Critics of the school choice movement,
they argue that pulling students

00:03:58.638 --> 00:03:59.138
and the funding

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:00.306
tied to them out of the public

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:03.409
schools, it's just accelerating
a debt spiral for those institutions.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.447
So you see things like between 2019 and
2023, enrollment declined by 20% or more,

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:11.217
at nearly 1 in 12 public schools, around
1000 public schools close every year.

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:13.386
It also, a Stanford analysis
found that majority black

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:15.888
public schools are far more likely
to be among those closures.

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:18.691
And the argument being you
drain public schools of students and money

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:21.828
that the quality then drops, more people
leave, the quality drops further,

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:23.229
and eventually the school just shuts down.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.131
And this is happening
disproportionately in communities

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:26.432
that already have the fewest options.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:27.934
And so this question
of whether you send your kid

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:30.303
to public school ends up
not just being a personal one.

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:33.539
It becomes a deeply political one
with real downstream consequences

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.508
for communities
that don't have the option to choose.

00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:38.544
And so for us personally, we've decided
to send our kids to public school.

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:39.579
We have the money to go private.

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:42.482
We've done it in the past, but this is
what feels right to us right now.

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:43.082
You know part of that.

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:45.551
It's also connected to my belief
that the best school for you,

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:48.321
especially K-12,
is the one that's closest to the schools,

00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:50.990
the infrastructure, the staff,
all of that. It matters.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.826
But also something that data is shown is
that kids are really able to thrive

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:56.496
when they're able to maximize
the time they have out of school.

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:58.164
And so part of that is connected
to how much time

00:04:58.164 --> 00:05:01.601
are you losing on the drive
or the bus into school and back,

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:03.603
or the kids that your kids are around
at school?

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:04.671
Also close by?

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:06.105
Is there sort of a community thing?

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:07.507
I mean, a lot of that it's connected
to, you know,

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:09.609
we're we're stronger and better together.

00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:12.612
There's also a whole thing I could talk
about with kids being lonelier than ever.

00:05:12.612 --> 00:05:15.682
And so it's important, you know, that
we're maximizing and doing things that

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:19.352
that help socialize
and then benefit kids outside of school.

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:20.820
So, you know, again, while I understand,
you know,

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.389
what you do with your kids,
it is a very personal issue.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.824
This is how I currently look at it.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.259
And I want to try and help

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.829
build up something rather than strip
something down and run away.

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.332
And then there's more we're going
to dive into based off of your questions.

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:34.200
But first,
let me take a minute to thank a sponsor

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.135
and say, you know, remember
when changing your password

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:37.370
meant adding a number to the end?

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.540
But it turns out millions of people's
Gmail passwords didn't stand a chance.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.109
And that's just another reason
why today's sponsor, NordVPN.

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:43.943
It's a must have.

00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:47.013
Security researchers have confirmed
that Gmail usernames and passwords

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:48.514
were included in a massive leak part.

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:52.485
About 183 million online accounts that are
floating around the dark web right now.

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:54.287
And the worst part is that
even if Google wasn't hacked,

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:55.621
your reused passwords across

00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:58.825
apps makes it insanely easy for hackers
to break into everything else you own.

00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:02.095
A Nordvpn's dark web monitor alerts
you the moment of your email or password

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:02.862
shows up in a leak.

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:04.964
So, you know, before any hacker tries
anything, you know,

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:08.101
all your internet traffic stays encrypted,
meaning that your data is yours,

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:10.770
even if the website that you're using
is held together with duct tape and hope.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.805
Plus, NordVPN has a strict no logs policy.

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:14.874
They're not tracking you, storing you,
or selling you.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:15.942
They protect you. Period.

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:17.610
You know I'm protected
and you should be too.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.412
Right now
you can get an exclusive discount

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:22.648
on a two year plan plus four
extra months free when you use my link.

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:24.150
And it's risk free with Nord's 30 day

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.987
money Back guarantee, you scan that code
or go to nordvpn.com/fill.

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:30.356
That's NordVPN incompetent.

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:31.257
But then next up today

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:34.394
we've got Matti from Canada coming in
with a question that I think, honestly,

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.295
a lot of Americans have thought about,
well,

00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:37.897
at least over the last year and a half.

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:40.767
So I was just wondering
if you would ever consider

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:44.003
leaving America
if things get really, really bad.

00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:46.472
So where I'll start is with polling,
because the numbers

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:48.541
they've shifted dramatically
in a very short period of time.

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:49.709
A 2025 Gallup poll

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:52.912
found that roughly 1 in 5 Americans
want to move abroad permanently.

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.347
And while that sounds like a lot,
and yes, it

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:56.315
definitely is, here's
what really makes it crazy.

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:58.584
It is more double
the number who said the same thing

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:00.153
a decade ago, where there's been a steady

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:03.189
climb since 2014,
and then it's just been accelerating.

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:05.525
I Harris poll last year
found that 4 in 10 Americans have either

00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:08.728
considered, or are actively planning
to move outside of the United States.

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.997
The people surveyed
specifically pointed to dissatisfaction

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:12.999
with current political leadership
as a primary reason.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:15.701
Also, a big thing. I'll say that
generational splits pretty stark.

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:18.971
Two thirds of Americans aged 18 to 34
say they've thought about leaving,

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:21.441
and that's from an American
Psychological Association survey.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.609
More than half of all parents
polled said the same.

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:24.510
Also, a Gallup flagging

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.547
something that they called a record
40% of women aged 15 to 44

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:30.216
said that they wanted to leave
the United States in 2025.

00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:32.819
And also with the situation,
you have Rainbow Railroad, a nonprofit

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:35.855
that helps LGBTQ plus people escape state
sponsored violence, saying

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:38.991
that it has received a record
high number of requests for help from U.S.

00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:40.626
citizens since Trump's reelection.

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:41.127
And so, yeah,

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:44.230
you have people saying they want to leave,
but are they actually doing?

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.065
And this is where I'll say, you know,
it gets harder to track.

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:47.400
You have experts saying that permanently

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.469
leaving a country,
it's genuinely difficult to measure.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.804
But the indicators we do have,
they're pretty telling.

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:55.374
In a report from CBS Global Partners
estimated that 1285

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:58.611
Americans renounced their citizenship
in just the first quarter of 2025.

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:01.547
There was a 102% increase
compared to the previous quarter.

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:02.014
Also, prior

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:05.918
to 2009, only a few hundred people
totally renounced citizenship per year.

00:08:05.918 --> 00:08:08.454
But the numbers
now appear to just keep going up and up.

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:09.822
And this is relocation.

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:12.425
Firms and expat communities
are reporting a surge in interest.

00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:16.095
Are you at one citizenship and residency
advisory firm reporting a 400% increase

00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:19.298
in American clients in the first quarter
of 2025 versus the year prior?

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:20.233
A record number of U.S.

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:23.603
citizens applied for UK passwords
in the first three months of last year.

00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:25.872
So Ireland
they saw American passport applications

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:28.140
soared during the same period,
and notably, Ireland

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.243
reported the number of Americans
who actually moved there

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:33.212
this past spring double than the year
before. And so it's not fully all talk.

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:36.649
But also experts are quick to point out
that a lot of the passport applications,

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:38.951
they're more of a break glass
in case of emergency move.

00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:39.385
Right people

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:41.654
securing options,
not necessarily booking flights,

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:43.623
but the fact that you have this increasing
number of Americans

00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:45.725
building an exit ramp,
that itself is significant.

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:48.160
And then actually there's
a domestic version of the same phenomenon.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.862
You have people
who aren't leaving the country,

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:51.764
but they're absolutely
leaving their state.

00:08:51.764 --> 00:08:53.633
And it's actually has a name.
It's called the big sort.

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:55.935
It's the trend of Americans
increasingly moving to places

00:08:55.935 --> 00:08:57.136
that match their political beliefs.

00:08:57.136 --> 00:08:59.005
And it's just been accelerating
for years now.

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:00.473
How many have voted Republican in 2020?

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:01.541
These are net population

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:04.644
gains of 3.7 million in the three years
following the election.

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:05.311
And a New York Times

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:08.014
analysis found that broadly,
more Democrats moved to Biden states,

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:09.815
while more Republicans
moved to Trump states.

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:12.518
Though it varies by location.
Right in Florida is the headline example.

00:09:12.518 --> 00:09:15.588
Over 200,000 registered Republicans
move there between the last two

00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:18.157
presidential elections, more than twice
the number of Democrats.

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:20.026
Meanwhile, after Biden
became the first Democrat to win

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.961
Georgia in almost 30 years, Democrats
actually

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:25.197
outnumbered Republicans
moving into Georgia between 2020 and 2024.

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:25.298
Right?

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:27.166
And that is, Democrats
have also made small migration

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:29.068
gains in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin
and Michigan.

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:31.571
California, though
I'll say it has seen more Republicans

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:35.641
leave than any other state, most heading
to Texas, Arizona, Florida and Nevada.

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:37.410
Now, not all of
that is purely political, right?

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.011
A cost of living and pandemic era

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:40.980
remote work shifts
that has played a role as well.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.349
So yeah, you could argue
that is political in just a different way.

00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:46.752
But also, a survey from early 2025
found that nearly half of Americans

00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:50.022
considering a move cited the political
climate as their primary motivation.

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:52.158
So, yes, clearly
politics is a major driver.

00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:53.025
So the picture that ends up

00:09:53.025 --> 00:09:55.461
getting painted here
is that you have a country sorting itself

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:57.296
geographically,
culturally and politically.

00:09:57.296 --> 00:10:00.032
People are voting with their feet,
whether that means moving to a suburb,

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:02.101
a bluer city
or a different country altogether.

00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:04.437
And as for my answer,
no, I'm not. I'm not going anywhere.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.539
Like I think a lot of people
who have jobs like myself,

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:08.774
I have a planned out escape plan
if need be.

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:09.642
You know, I love my country.

00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:10.109
I've loved

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:13.212
the last two states that I've lived in,
whether it be California or now Georgia.

00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:14.280
I want to be a part of the change

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.682
that I want to see in this world
and in this country.

00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:17.950
But yeah, at the same time, I'd be lying

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.319
if I said
sometimes I didn't get kind of nervous,

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:22.088
or the government's
been weaponized against anyone

00:10:22.088 --> 00:10:25.191
who wants to stand against Trump
or even speak truth to power.

00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:27.760
And so for me personally, there are
there are a few different,

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.163
canaries in the coal mine
that I won't specifically call out that,

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:34.967
you know, I just,
I always, here keep an ear open for it,

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:37.203
but the next ever,
that we've got a guy named Phil.

00:10:37.203 --> 00:10:41.207
Fantastic name, by the way, who asked why
I decided to launch new podcasts.

00:10:41.207 --> 00:10:42.575
I want to know what made.

00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:44.610
You decide to go back to podcasting?

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.781
I would love to know your thought
process behind starting a podcast,

00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:53.552
and where you think
they're going to go from here as a medium.

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:55.721
And actually where I'll start here
is, you know, the podcasting world.

00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:57.256
It is kind of fascinating.

00:10:57.256 --> 00:10:59.825
And I also don't think people fully
appreciate what's going on in the space

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:01.027
because despite what you've seen,

00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:04.130
maybe a stray headline say here or there,
podcast is not dying.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.032
It is absolutely exploding. Still.

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:08.834
Yes, the pandemic era gold rush of people
launching shows it.

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:09.802
That's largely over,

00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:14.473
but we saw over a million new podcast
launch in 2020, another 750,020 21

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:17.910
and then launch is kind of fell off
a cliff, down 80% by 2022.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.145
And that can sound bad on the surface.

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:22.648
But what those numbers actually tell you
is that the hobbyist bubble burst.

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:26.419
And so it's laughter, real things
that might have core staying power

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:28.487
at the very least,
are not these kind of fickle things.

00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:30.690
And actually, new show
launches have been taking back up.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.459
Around 205,000
new podcasts were launched in 2025,

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:35.961
which is up from roughly 198,000
the year before.

00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:38.130
But also, more importantly,
the audience never stopped growing.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.633
In fact, it's been growing faster
than almost anyone predicted.

00:11:40.633 --> 00:11:44.670
Right now, roughly 584 million
people worldwide listen to podcasts,

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.373
and that's more than double
than what it was six years ago, right?

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:49.742
Analysts projected that number is
just going to keep going up and up.

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:52.778
And in the US specifically,
more than half of all Americans over 12,

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:55.848
they've watched or listen to a podcast
in just the last month in ten.

00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:56.782
They did it last week.

00:11:56.782 --> 00:11:58.350
Once the listeners have more than tripled

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.854
in the last decade, weekly listeners,
they've more than quadrupled in the money.

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:03.222
It's followed accordingly. Right?

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:06.859
The global podcast market
was valued at roughly $47 billion in 2025,

00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:11.230
and projections have it nearly quadrupling
to around 171 billion by 2030.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.865
This can start as, yeah, a hobby.

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:16.435
But the whole thing, it's not a niche
hobby, it's a genuine media industry.

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:18.270
And also it's
say a huge driver of that growth.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.773
Now is video
or the shift of video podcasting.

00:12:20.773 --> 00:12:23.142
That's been a massive accelerate.
130 U.S. podcast.

00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:26.178
Consumers now say that they prefer shows
with video, and the markets responded.

00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:28.180
The number of shows
posting full videos on YouTube

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.849
has more than doubled since 2022,

00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:32.651
with over half of all podcasts
now uploading video content.

00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:34.553
You got YouTube
reporting over a billion monthly

00:12:34.553 --> 00:12:37.890
podcast viewers as of 2025,
and by some metrics, they've now surpassed

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.761
Apple and Spotify as a top platform for
podcast consumption in the United States.

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:44.764
Now, it's also become the number one place
that people discovering new shows,

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:46.599
but also see,
this is where it gets really interesting

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.367
from a cultural
or political standpoint, right?

00:12:48.367 --> 00:12:50.669
Because podcasting, it's
not just entertainment anymore.

00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:54.140
It is arguably the most influential media
outlet in the country right now.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.175
I mean, a Pew survey
found that a third of Americans

00:12:56.175 --> 00:12:59.812
now get at least some of their news
from podcasts, up from just 22% in 2020.

00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:02.181
And the ideological makeup
of the audience, it's shifting.

00:13:02.181 --> 00:13:03.816
Edison Research data shows conservative

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:07.920
listeners jumped from 23% to 30%
between 2019 and 2024.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.588
And actually, some 2025 data suggests

00:13:09.588 --> 00:13:12.591
that conservatives now outnumber liberals
among news podcast listeners.

00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:12.691
Right.

00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:14.627
And with all of this,
we saw how consequential

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.162
this got with the 2024 election.

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:18.497
A race that was widely dubbed
the podcast Election year.

00:13:18.497 --> 00:13:22.201
Trump went on 20 individual podcasts
between July and November of 2024.

00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:25.971
He had flagrante the of on grief
or sand impulsive and more.

00:13:25.971 --> 00:13:27.740
A lot of the same guys that were like,
oh my God,

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.342
I can't believe he's doing this,
even though everyone warned me that.

00:13:30.342 --> 00:13:32.545
Also, as far as Harris,
she appeared on eight.

00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:34.213
And also many of the hosts
that Trump spoke

00:13:34.213 --> 00:13:36.615
with went on to endorse
or vote for him. Right leaning podcasters.

00:13:36.615 --> 00:13:38.250
They were widely credited
with helping Trump

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.319
close the gap,
especially with younger male voters.

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:42.254
And then, of course,
we fast forward to more recent times.

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:45.124
And you people looking at Zoran Mamdani,
he's a very progressive candidate

00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:46.892
with a lot of populist ideals
and of course,

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:49.395
that is a big chunk of the reason
why people voted for him.

00:13:49.395 --> 00:13:52.031
But also, you have to note that
he appeared on 31 podcasts,

00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:54.967
including flagrant,
whose host Andrew Schultz voted for Trump.

00:13:54.967 --> 00:13:57.002
And all the while,
you have top charts across platforms

00:13:57.002 --> 00:13:58.871
continuing to be dominated by news
adjacent

00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:02.975
shows like The Daily, Tucker
Carlson, Jerry the of on Candace Owens.

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:05.978
His podcast ranked in the top
three for downloads and views per month.

00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:07.479
An episode earlier this year.

00:14:07.479 --> 00:14:08.380
And then, of course, on the left,

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.251
you've got Pod Save America, first
the The Midas Touch Podcast and more.

00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:14.153
You know, since the election,
many have had a wild ride

00:14:14.153 --> 00:14:16.555
at times unseating Rogan
at the top of the YouTube charts.

00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:17.857
You know, it's
one of the reasons I've been covering

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:20.092
big right wingers
like Owens and more on the show.

00:14:20.092 --> 00:14:22.027
A lot of people I know
still think of her as a sideshow,

00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:24.263
and don't realize
not only how the right has taken over

00:14:24.263 --> 00:14:27.933
such a huge chunk of the space, but how
they are moving in these spaces sometimes.

00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:29.602
Yes, it's to highlight
how they're fighting

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:30.603
and the basis for action,

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:34.340
but also is because we need to highlight
what's informing millions of people

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.542
per platform in our country
compared to mainstream

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:38.177
sources in the past,
and many of them do it.

00:14:38.177 --> 00:14:40.546
Owens and Ben Shapiro
come to mind first by trying to hit

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:42.014
pop culture moments hard, right?

00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:44.817
These nonpolitical things,
and then they slowly transition

00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:47.653
their audience
and or they battle some sort of big bad.

00:14:47.653 --> 00:14:48.220
It's for Owens.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.955
It could be everything
that's been happening with TP,

00:14:49.955 --> 00:14:53.158
USA in the wake of Charlie Kirk's murder,
or the president of France

00:14:53.158 --> 00:14:55.160
because she's alleged
his wife is actually trans,

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.364
or they benefited from the second term
of Trump is sort of resistance podcasts.

00:14:58.364 --> 00:15:00.366
And so the point is,
you know, the space it's not shrinking.

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:01.400
It's consolidating power.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.601
People who are still here,
they're building

00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:04.703
real audiences,
real influence and real money.

00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:07.473
And that influence on culture and
politics, it's just going to keep growing.

00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:09.642
And so to bring all of that
to now, my personal answer

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:12.411
bit of it was emotional and mental
and a bit of it was strategy really.

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:15.447
Reached out to Alex Pearlman
to start our podcast Crashing out.

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:19.084
I wanted a place to kind of shoot the shit
and also be able to genuinely crash out

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:22.821
or go more opinion than just kind of
talking about what is actually happening.

00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:25.557
Or the Philip DeFranco show,
which I guess is also a podcast is news,

00:15:25.557 --> 00:15:28.694
news new is a little bit of opinion
crashing and it's kind of the opposite.

00:15:28.727 --> 00:15:30.963
So for me that was something
I emotionally and mentally needed.

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:34.967
But also it happens to kind of fit
in perfectly with our strategy of trying

00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:36.902
to reach more people, different people.

00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:38.504
And as far as my podcast, in good faith,

00:15:38.504 --> 00:15:40.205
that again,
it's a little bit of a mixture.

00:15:40.205 --> 00:15:42.241
It's weird saying,
this is someone who's been talking for a

00:15:42.241 --> 00:15:46.045
living for 20 years, but for who I am
at my core, like just 90% of the time.

00:15:46.045 --> 00:15:49.648
I would rather be asking a question
and listening rather than just talking.

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:51.650
So initially
I wanted that to have kind of more long

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.585
form conversations
with people in the political space.

00:15:53.585 --> 00:15:55.688
But as we're setting up for the 2026
season of that show,

00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:57.389
it's going to be a little more
of a mish mash.

00:15:57.389 --> 00:16:00.559
Yes, some people in the political space,
but also having a taste of what I had

00:16:00.559 --> 00:16:02.928
with my really old podcast,
a conversation with where

00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:05.130
I was really just kind of
sitting down, hanging,

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.800
learning about a person
and it almost being built

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.601
more for their audience
and a little for my own.

00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:13.639
I think over time, I want in good faith
to be kind of less, blatantly political.

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:15.140
And that can just kind of
be something in the background,

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.008
because of course,

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:18.110
everything is politics
and, well, there's definitely an appetite

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.612
and need to stay on top of
what's happening politically now.

00:16:20.612 --> 00:16:21.580
I get a lot of joy from.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:25.651
But then in search strategy,
there is a lot of power with news adjacent

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:30.155
show, with news adjacent news adjacent
that news adjacent shows.

00:16:30.789 --> 00:16:32.558
But that, my friends,
is the end of your Friday.

00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:35.461
Philip DeFranco show. The end of
From the Bastards for this week.

00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:37.429
If you'd like to send in your own
question or topic,

00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:39.031
I've got a link for you
in the description.

00:16:39.031 --> 00:16:39.932
I know a few of you are shy.

00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:42.501
You don't want to share your voice,
so you can also leave a question

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:43.836
in the comments that might get picked up.

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:46.638
But hey, where I'll leave you for
now is to say thank you for watching.

00:16:46.638 --> 00:16:47.673
I love your faces.

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.341
If you want more to watch,
you can watch it.

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:52.344
Last night's Philip DeFranco show
or the newest episode of Crashing Out.

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:53.112
But whatever you do,

00:16:53.112 --> 00:16:56.382
I'll see you right back here on Monday
with another full Philip DeFranco show.

00:16:56.782 --> 00:16:58.517
I'm gonna ask you a question
here in a second,

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:01.053
and you can tell me to go fuck myself
and cut it.

00:17:01.053 --> 00:17:02.054
I was going to preface that.

00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:04.556
You're thinking, that's. A great one.
How did you find that?

00:17:04.556 --> 00:17:07.026
What kind of research are you doing?
You won't get used to.

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:11.096
You'll never have to pay the bill if they
give you a really good piece of advice.

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:13.499
I was horrible
the one time I've been fired from a job.
