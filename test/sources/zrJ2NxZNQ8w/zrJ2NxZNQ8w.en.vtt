00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:02.535
Ilhan Omar was attacked at her event
last night in Minnesota.

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:05.538
And now you've got Trump trying to say
that the whole thing is fake.

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:06.272
Here's the clip.

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:09.843
DHS Secretary Kristi Noem must resign

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.812
or face impeachment.

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:15.749
Quickly.

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.752
00001

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.321
that's cool.

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:21.955
I don't know.

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.190
But immediately
after Omar called for Ice to be abolished

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.193
and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi
Noem to resign or be impeached,

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:31.031
55 year old Anthony James Keziah Zach
stood up and sprayed her with an unknown

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.332
liquid from a large syringe.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.801
Also, he reportedly yelled
that Omar needs to resign.

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:37.103
And right now, while
we don't know what the liquid is yet.

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:38.371
One BBC journalist in the room

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.474
said it had a sour smell, like a chemical
that the New York Times reporting on.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:43.309
It smelled like vinegar
and we had many, you know,

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.878
happy that there weren't any injuries.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.980
You had many kind of amazed
by the response.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.382
Omar looking like she was going
to punch the guy for a second.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:52.452
Also, she refused Security's efforts
to move her offstage to safety

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:53.853
after the man was taken into custody.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.189
She then went back to speaking
and as she was leaving,

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.391
she told reporters at the event,
I survived war

00:00:58.391 --> 00:00:59.025
and I'm definitely going

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.261
to survive intimidation
and whatever these people think

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.063
that they can throw at me
because I'm built that way.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.999
And then after she went on Twitter to say,
I'm okay, I'm a survivor.

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:09.202
So this small agitator isn't
going to intimidate me from doing my work.

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:10.403
I don't let bullies win.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.006
And we're right now we're trying to learn
more about this guy and his motive.

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.308
It does right now
look like it was a premeditated attack.

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:17.077
Or you have a neighbor
telling that New York Post

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:18.511
that because Mayor Zach asked him to

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.547
walk his dog
so that he could go to Omar's event,

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:21.481
he apparently even hinted

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.982
that something was going to happen
with the neighbors

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:25.718
saying that because Mayor Zach said
that he might get arrested anyway.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.454
This neighbor going on to say that
because Mayor Zach

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:29.856
has been heavily medicated
from a car accident years before,

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.492
that messed up his mind
as well as being diagnosed Parkinson's.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.294
You also know from the neighbor
that he apparently leans

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.696
conservative, and social media pages
apparently belong to him.

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:39.732
Show a history of supporting Trump
and right wing commentators, including Ben

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:41.000
Shapiro and Candace Owens.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.970
I really wonder where he landed
in the past year with those two.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.039
This guy is now being charged
with third degree assault

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.273
and he's being held without bail.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.942
Well, we'll have to wait
to see what happens there.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.478
In the meantime, we've seen a mixed bag
of reactions to this.

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:53.113
You have many officials
condemning the attack,

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:56.449
speaking out against political violence,
some Democrats laying the blame for this

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:58.284
at the feet of Donald Trump,
like Representative

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:01.087
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,
who said it's not a coincidence

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:04.224
that after days of President Trump
and VP Vance putting Representative Omar

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:06.459
in their crosshairs
with slander as public attacks,

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.662
she gets assaulted at her town
hall yelling Thank God she is okay.

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:11.297
If they want leaders
to take down the temperature,

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:12.532
they need to look in the mirror.

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:14.868
Well, yeah, if you look into it.
Trump has spent recent months

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:17.237
targeting Ilhan Omar
with some pretty nasty rhetoric.

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:20.206
And in fact, yesterday,
the very same day that Omar was attacked,

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:22.175
Trump was shit talking to her while
speaking in Iowa.

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:25.478
Not like Ilhan Omar. Did you see what

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.648
did you see that wise guy.

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:31.050
You know, she's always talking
about the Constitution. No.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.253
Provides me with the following.

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:34.554
You know, the Constitution.

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:37.090
She comes from a country
that's a disaster.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.293
It's a probably it's considered,
I think the word it's not even a country.

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:41.828
And then when he heard about this attack,

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:44.097
he told a reporter, quote,
I think she's a fraud.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:45.431
I really don't think about that.

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:47.600
She probably had herself
sprayed knowing her.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.171
Now with that on one side, too many
finding that reaction disgusting though.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.906
Also some people finding it suspicious,

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:55.441
wondering why Trump's
first reaction to theirs was to assume

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.644
that a politician
would fake an attack on themselves

00:02:57.644 --> 00:02:59.546
during an election year
for some political gain.

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.748
But then also too, as you might imagine,
this really fanned

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:04.083
the flames of his supporters
to speculate that Omar

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:05.385
somehow staged this whole thing.

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:06.886
He saw people online
going through the video

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:08.388
and saying that she nodded at the guy

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:09.489
before he attacked her,

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.124
saying that, you know,
she didn't react the way

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:13.593
that she should have if she was attacked.
So it must be fake.

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:16.496
And all of this is we know that this woman
has faced increased death threats

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:18.665
since Trump took office again
and started making some insane

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:21.868
claims about her, including that she's
now worth more than $40 million,

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:23.903
which is to explain
where he's getting that number

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:26.139
in her financial disclosures
from last spring, Omar

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.141
valued her husband's venture
capital management

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:31.411
firm, and his winery is worth
between 5 million and $25 million

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:33.813
and between 1 million
and $5 million, respectively.

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:35.515
So the very top range of those numbers

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:38.518
is where Trump and co,
they're getting a worth $44 million.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.954
But as Forbes pointed out,
even if those businesses were operating

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:43.723
at the tippity top of those ranges,
that's still not accurate

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:45.592
for how much Omar
or even her husband's worth.

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:47.961
And in fact, you had her late last year
explaining that her husband

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:50.263
is a partner in those ventures,
and the numbers that she included

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:53.333
are the business's total value,
not just the value of his ownership stake,

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:54.801
though also, with that, it is worth noting

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:57.103
that she's been at the center
of a Justice Department investigation

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:59.672
since the Biden days,
specifically focused on her finances,

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:02.141
campaign spending, and interactions
with a foreign citizen.

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:03.676
Well, reportedly,
it looks like things have stalled

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:04.477
on that front due to there

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:07.413
being a lack of evidence in recent weeks,
GOP members of the House,

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:09.315
they've been threatening
to open their own investigation

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:12.118
into Omar as a way of connecting her
to the Minnesota fraud scheme,

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:14.654
especially after evidence revealed
that some members of Minnesota's

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:17.156
Somali community
set up companies to build state agencies

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:18.691
for social services
that were never provided.

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:20.627
But I'll say at this point,
there's no evidence

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:22.495
to connect Omar herself
to any fraud scheme,

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:24.731
and her office has reportedly received
no official inquiries

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.633
from the oversight committee
or the Trump DOJ.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.534
So, as it stands
now, it's just Trump and his goons

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:30.903
fanning the flames of political violence
with their aggressive rhetoric.

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:33.273
But also, you know,
despite these relentless verbal attacks

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.509
and even physical attacks on Minnesota's
elected representatives Tuesday,

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.911
it was actually a good day for Democrats,
at least in one way,

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:40.179
because they actually won two seats

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:42.448
in the Minnesota State House
after special elections yesterday.

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:44.684
And it was significant
not because it was surprising, actually.

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:46.519
You know,
these were both deep blue districts.

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:46.853
In fact,

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:48.655
the Democrat was the only candidate
on the ballot

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:50.590
for one of them,
but rather because it restores

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.661
the even Partizan split in the House there
with 67 Democrats and 67 Republicans.

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:56.462
And that helps them a lot,
because the Senate Democrats

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:57.463
already have a slim majority.

00:04:57.463 --> 00:04:59.532
And of course, you have Tim Walz,
the Democratic governor.

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:01.534
So, well, they still need some Republican
support to pass things.

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:03.636
They can at least use the power
that they have to resist

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.738
the federal invasion,
even if that just means things

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:08.241
like holding hearings to spotlight
what the feds are doing there.

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:10.443
As a state Senate
subcommittee is set to do this week.

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:13.379
Also on that note,
the two agents who used their guns on Alex

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.481
Brady have reportedly been
put on administrative leave. Right.

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:16.983
Because before the CBP said that they were

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.152
just still out in the field,
just not in Minneapolis.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.554
Now, DHS,
they say this move is standard procedure

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:24.023
and it shouldn't be viewed
as suspicion of wrongdoing.

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:25.725
Still,
you know, five days after the shooting,

00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:27.460
the identities of the agents
haven't been released.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.830
And despite all the talk about some agents
leaving Minnesota with Greg Bovino,

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.900
it's far from clear that Trump's
troopers are actually pulling out at all.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.068
Because, you know, people like can clip.

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:36.936
And Steen revealing
that he's obtained a Border Patrol

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:39.939
memo saying that federal deployment
to Minneapolis is a steady state

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:41.374
and expected to continue as planned.

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:43.309
You also had Trump himself
clarifying yesterday

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:45.645
that whatever he's doing,
it is not a pullback.

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:48.281
We're going to de-escalate a little bit,
but I don't think it's a pullback.

00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:49.449
It's a little bit of a challenge.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.585
Everyone in this room that has a business,
you know you make little changes.

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:54.287
You know Bovino is very good.

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:56.756
But he's a pretty out there kind of a guy.

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:58.925
And in some cases that's good.
Maybe it wasn't good.

00:05:58.925 --> 00:05:59.525
He had almost

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:02.862
all of the headlines have focused on
the we're going to de-escalate a bit part.

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:05.131
Everything that he says after that,
it seems to suggest

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:07.100
that, you know, he's
just maybe kicking Bovino out,

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.536
but not meaningfully drawing down ISIS
presence in Minnesota so far.

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:11.471
Besides, Tom Homan

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:14.941
meeting with state and local officials,
we haven't seen evidence of de-escalation.

00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:16.676
In fact,
if anything, we're seeing the opposite.

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:18.578
I mean, we're seeing things
we didn't even know to expect.

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:21.948
There's video now showing Ice agents
trying to get inside the Ecuadorian

00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:25.718
consulate, which, just to be clear, it is,
I guess you'd call it a big no no.

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:28.621
Like international law and obvious norms,
though, norms don't matter, generally

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:30.089
prohibit law enforcement authorities

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:32.692
from entering foreign consulates
or embassies without permission.

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:33.192
So in the video,

00:06:33.192 --> 00:06:35.895
you see a staffer running to the door
to turn the agents away, telling them,

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.464
this is the Ecuadorian consulate,
you're not allowed to enter.

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:41.667
And then you can hear one of the agents
respond by threatening to grab the staffer

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:42.402
if he touch the agent.

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:44.470
That they
then eventually left in the consulate

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.339
later posted
that it ensured the protection

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:48.341
of the Ecuadorians
who were present at the time, adding

00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:51.878
that it activated the emergency protocols
and filed a note of protest with the U.S.

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:55.014
embassy in Ecuador so that similar
attempts are not made on other consulate.

00:06:55.014 --> 00:06:57.450
But also, you know, this chaos. It's
not just happening in Minnesota.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.652
It's ongoing in
other parts of the country as well.

00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:01.721
Are you authorities
saying that that suspects in connection

00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:04.891
with an alleged human trafficking incident
was shot during an exchange of gunfire

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:06.058
with Border Patrol yesterday?

00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:09.128
That man in serious but stable condition
with no officers hurt.

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:11.130
And now, while that incident
is under investigation,

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.133
you also people looking for accountability
for all the lies we're told.

00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:15.001
With Alex spreading.

00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:17.036
And currently,
the conversation inside of the white House

00:07:17.036 --> 00:07:20.339
seems to be focused on one big question
who is to blame?

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:23.509
Stephen Miller, Kristi Noem, Greg Bovino
or someone else entirely?

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:25.244
Because according to Axios, some officials
blame

00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:28.014
the CBP officers on the ground
for creating an initial report

00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:30.483
that left them with the belief
that he had brandished a gun,

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:32.318
and that even though we all saw
with our own eyes

00:07:32.318 --> 00:07:34.220
with those videos,
that that is just not true.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.788
And in fact, Border Patrol itself

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:37.790
is now backed off of that claim
in the mandatory notice

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.626
that it has to provide to Congress anytime
someone dies in its custody,

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:42.361
or with them
claiming after their investigation

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:45.631
that after agents try to detain Brady,
he resisted, they struggled.

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:47.166
One agent yelled he's got a gun!

00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:49.469
And two Border
Patrol officers fired Glock pistols.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:52.004
But that report makes no mention of Brady
brandishing his own gun,

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:54.907
or of the agents firing at themselves,
accidentally or otherwise.

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:58.344
But either way, what most people are
focused on is what DHS posted in its

00:07:58.344 --> 00:08:01.714
now infamous press statement on Twitter
just a couple of hours after the shooting.

00:08:01.714 --> 00:08:04.784
And it was also something that was echoed
almost verbatim by Kristi

00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:05.952
Noem and Greg Bovino.

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:07.453
In fact,
some people might not have noticed this,

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:10.923
but if you play them side by side,
they are clearly just reading a script,

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:11.858
an individual.

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:13.226
An individual, a U.S..

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:15.495
Border Patrol, patrol officers
with the nine.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.997
Millimeter semi-automatic handgun.

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:20.333
The officers attempted to this individual

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:23.936
disarm the individual suspect,
but he violently resisted.

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:25.938
Both of them
just lying on this man's name, claiming

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:29.809
that he intended to cause maximum damage
and massacre federal agents.

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:31.611
Now Axios,
they report that the white House

00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:33.546
officials,
who never signed off on that statement,

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.848
they're frustrated at one source
saying that some people tried

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:37.316
to clean up the statement
before it was sent,

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:38.818
but it had already been disseminated.

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:42.021
But still, one of those in the know
appear to be Stephen Miller,

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.991
because he posted his own comment
just minutes later, calling Brady

00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:47.560
an assassin,
which was also reposted by J.D. Vance.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.563
And in fact, one source told Axios
that immediately following the shooting,

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:53.466
Stephen Miller heard gun
and knew what the narrative would be.

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:55.134
He came to massacre cops.

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:57.770
As if you believe that account,
then everything just flowed from there,

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.139
with a person
recalling that, Noam told them, everything

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:03.309
I've done, I've done at the direction
of the president and Stephen

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.478
because, well, technically,
since Miller is just the deputy

00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:09.048
chief of staff, his official title
no amount ranks him as cabinet secretary.

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:12.451
Practically, Miller's real power
far outstrips his official title

00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:14.954
and reportedly includes
de facto oversight of known.

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:17.390
Personally, I think Stephen Miller
is the one that's been running things.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.991
It's why I call him
President Stephen Miller.

00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:21.427
Donald Trump is kind of
just his empty vessel, his hammer.

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:24.330
With this, you had Miller himself
pointing his finger back at CBP,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.365
saying that any early comments
that were made

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:28.467
were based on
what it sent to the white House.

00:09:28.467 --> 00:09:31.637
And that is another source blaming
Greg Bovino for feeding misinformation

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:32.572
to officials in DC.

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:33.606
Then, you know, with all this,

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:36.008
we have people outside of the white House
arguing the whole blame game.

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:38.311
It misses where the real guilt ultimately
lies.

00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:42.281
President Donald Trump, because not only
was he reportedly kept Apprized of the DHS

00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:45.585
press statement by Miller
and Nome's top advisor Corey Lewandowski,

00:09:45.618 --> 00:09:49.021
he also is the man at top who created
all of the conditions for this to happen.

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:49.956
And so, so much of the

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:53.893
mainstream conversation around
this is who will get to be his fall guy.

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:56.329
If anyone reads a classic
authoritarian tactic,

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:59.832
Supreme Leader is safe
and he just moves pieces, removes pieces.

00:09:59.832 --> 00:10:01.934
And of course, don't forget
that he joined the maligning

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:04.203
of the first Minnesota civilian
who was killed. Renee. Good.

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:06.272
And I'll also add there,
the since the shooting,

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:07.974
he has hardly modified his stance.

00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:09.542
Yesterday
you had him calling that the shooting

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:12.378
unfortunate, but also seeming to at least
partially blame

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:15.081
for exercising his Second Amendment
right to carry a firearm.

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:16.482
I don't like that he had a gun.

00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:18.784
I don't like that
he had two fully loaded magazines.

00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:19.952
That's a lot of bad stuff.

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:21.153
Trump that also repeated something

00:10:21.153 --> 00:10:24.156
similar elsewhere, saying, quote,
you know, you can't have guns,

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:27.360
you can't walk in with guns,
can't walk into this, you can't do that.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.127
But then also saying

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:30.863
he feels worse about Renee
good than he does with Alex Brady

00:10:30.863 --> 00:10:33.032
because goods
parents are apparently Trump fans.

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:36.569
And I'm not sure about his parents, but
I know her parents were big Trump fans.

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:38.804
Makes me feel bad anyway.

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:41.240
But I mean,
I guess you could say even worse.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.742
They were tremendous.

00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:44.877
Trump people. Trump Trump fans.

00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:48.514
Now, as far as the reaction to Trump's
seemingly anti to comments,

00:10:48.514 --> 00:10:51.617
you had the NRA coming out
with one of the most lukewarm statements

00:10:51.617 --> 00:10:53.119
I have ever seen from them, saying,

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:55.688
while not referencing Trump
or any specific incident,

00:10:55.688 --> 00:10:58.290
the NRA unequivocally believes
that all law abiding citizens

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.327
have a right to keep and bear arms
anywhere they have a legal right to be.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.996
Whereas of course,
if for like a Biden or Obama said this,

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:07.099
it would be like
you'd have 15 emails in your inbox,

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:10.169
we're under attack
every like all caps Twitter posts.

00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:14.306
But that double standard aside,
as far as Trump in Iowa, he then let loose

00:11:14.306 --> 00:11:16.108
another barrage of attacks on immigrants.

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:19.278
We have brought down
crime very substantially in Minnesota.

00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:23.482
We've taken out thousands of hard
criminals, hardened, vicious,

00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:24.417
horrible criminals.

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:29.055
2% of the population
causes 90% of the crime.

00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:32.491
So when you start decimating that 2%.

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:34.026
Boom, there just to be clear here,

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:37.263
available data shows that the vast
majority of people arrested by Ice

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:39.331
in recent months,
they have no criminal offenses

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:41.934
and a very small fraction
actually committed violent crimes.

00:11:41.934 --> 00:11:44.837
But, you know, still, Trump and his allies
continuing to paint this crackdown

00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:48.307
as a restoration of law and order
that is targeting the worst of the worst.

00:11:48.307 --> 00:11:49.742
And you're seeing that argument
not just coming from

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:53.512
people like Nick Fuentes or Jesse Waters,
but even folks like Ben Shapiro,

00:11:53.512 --> 00:11:56.682
who Shapiro just released a video called
Are We Headed Towards Civil War?

00:11:56.682 --> 00:11:58.951
And would you claims
that the shootings of any good

00:11:58.951 --> 00:12:02.154
Alex Brady were the result of obstruction
from protesters and rhetoric

00:12:02.154 --> 00:12:02.922
from Democrats?

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:05.591
This is a left wing chaos operation.

00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:08.461
The Insurrection Act is not new. It's
not even all that unusual.

00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:10.062
When President Eisenhower sent troops

00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:12.231
into little Rock to enforce
Brown versus board,

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:13.766
the left called him a civil rights hero.

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:16.802
When President Trump threatens to use
the Insurrection Act, left calls him

00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:20.206
a fascist dictator
who is conspiring to destroy our republic.

00:12:20.372 --> 00:12:21.107
Give me a break.

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:24.276
But also speaking of fascist dictators
conspiring to destroy our republic,

00:12:24.276 --> 00:12:26.879
Trump's FBI announced today
that it's executing a search warrant

00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:28.881
at an election office in Fulton County,
Georgia.

00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:31.851
The source telling CNN that it's related
to the Trump DOJ's efforts

00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:33.819
to seize election records
in search of voter fraud.

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:35.588
But because Fulton County is home
to Atlanta,

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:38.157
and it's swung for Biden
by a large margin in 2020,

00:12:38.157 --> 00:12:40.993
that led to that now infamous phone call
where you had Trump trying to pressure

00:12:40.993 --> 00:12:43.829
the state's top election officials
to overturn the results in his favor.

00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:45.831
We think that if you check the signatures,

00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:50.002
a real check of the signatures
going back in Fulton County, you'll find

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:54.673
at least a couple of hundred
thousand of forged signatures left.

00:12:55.007 --> 00:12:56.542
Well, I want to do is this.

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:57.977
I just want to find,

00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:05.851
11,780 votes, which is one more that we.

00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:08.721
Have now with this whole situation
last month of the Justice Department's

00:13:08.721 --> 00:13:11.257
civil Rights Division
suing Fulton County Force

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:13.392
officials to turn over ballots
from the 2020 election.

00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:15.661
But the judge in the case
actually hasn't made a ruling yet.

00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:18.130
So apparently the FBI's just decided
to pounce away.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.800
You've got a spokesperson for the county
telling the Guardian that officials

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.536
there, they're scrambling to understand
the nature and target of the search.

00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:26.071
But also, Georgia's not the only state
that Trump's going after, right?

00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:26.872
His DOJ,

00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:29.542
they've sued several others
for their voter data. And judges

00:13:29.542 --> 00:13:32.344
have tossed a few of those cases out,
most recently this week in Oregon.

00:13:32.344 --> 00:13:33.813
So with the midterms
coming up this November,

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.714
we're going to have to wait
to see how this plays out.

00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:39.752
Also, will Trump's goons stop in Georgia
or will they go much, much further?

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:40.820
And what happens there?

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.022
And then there's more
we're going to dive into in just a minute.

00:13:43.022 --> 00:13:44.523
But first, let me thank a sponsor and say,

00:13:44.523 --> 00:13:46.592
you ever download a game just to try it

00:13:46.592 --> 00:13:48.260
and suddenly
you're up at 2:00 in the morning

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.129
planning boss fights
like it's your second job?

00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:51.397
That's
what happened when I picked up this game,

00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:53.666
because it dropped
one of the coolest crossovers I've seen.

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:56.235
Today's sponsor, Raid Shadow
Legends, has teamed up with Assassins

00:13:56.235 --> 00:13:59.338
Creed, and five
legendary assassins are now playable Ezio,

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:02.474
Edward Kenway by Byock, SIM, and Cassandra

00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:05.911
I get this you can unlock Ezio for free
just by logging in for seven days.

00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:06.679
Limited time thing.

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:07.446
Don't sleep on it.

00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:10.015
Insanely faithful animations,
weapons, everything.

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:11.851
Like you know, they just walk straight
out of the AC game.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:14.620
Ezio can stack nasty debuffs
and then slicer defenses

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.622
with a hidden blade
feeling. Barry Assassin.

00:14:16.622 --> 00:14:19.525
Plus, there's a new event dungeon
with Pontiff Augustine, special gear

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:22.728
rewards, and more ways to earn the other
assassins the events and tournaments.

00:14:22.728 --> 00:14:25.297

But then getting back into the news.
More news you need to know.

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:49.255
Russia has now suffered more casualties
in Ukraine than in any conflict

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:51.957
it's been a part of since World War Two,
and that's just one reason

00:14:51.957 --> 00:14:55.160
that experts are arguing that Putin, he's
just captaining a sinking ship

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.463
and that his victory,
it is far from inevitable.

00:14:57.463 --> 00:15:01.267
But Ukraine, the hurting two rate talks,
have yet to yield real results.

00:15:01.267 --> 00:15:03.636
And the Kremlin
got a lot of dirty tricks in their back.

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:05.371
And so there's a lot
that we've got to unpack together.

00:15:05.371 --> 00:15:06.005
Where we're going to start

00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:07.773
are with the talks
that took place over the weekend

00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:10.142
between Russian,
Ukrainian and American officials.

00:15:10.142 --> 00:15:12.311
They were the first involving
all three countries at once.

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:14.346
And initially they kind of seem to go
weirdly well.

00:15:14.346 --> 00:15:17.316
You had Zelensky saying on social media
that more meetings would be planned,

00:15:17.316 --> 00:15:19.184
provided
there is a readiness to move forward.

00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:22.354
You with the Kremlin apparently agreeing,
saying that talks would resume next week.

00:15:22.354 --> 00:15:23.722
And you also had Zelensky saying

00:15:23.722 --> 00:15:27.493
that a US document on security guarantees
for Ukraine was 100% ready, and that it's

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:29.495
now just a matter of picking a time
and a place for it

00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:30.963
to be signed, saying the document will

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:33.999
then be sent for ratification of the US
Congress in the Ukrainian parliament.

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:35.834
But then the cracks started to show.

00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:37.736
Are you at the Financial Times
reporting of the US?

00:15:37.736 --> 00:15:39.571
Told Ukraine
that they'd have to sign a peace deal

00:15:39.571 --> 00:15:41.674
with Russia
before getting security guarantees,

00:15:41.674 --> 00:15:43.676
and that any deal would involve
giving up land.

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:45.878
But then Reuters spoke to a source
who claimed

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:48.647
the US wasn't trying to force Ukraine
into territorial concessions.

00:15:48.647 --> 00:15:49.348
So ultimately

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:51.016
it appears that this continues
to be the question

00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:53.552
that could just screw up any chance
of an agreement with the Kremlin.

00:15:53.552 --> 00:15:54.887
They reportedly said on the deal
that it said

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:56.755
that Trump agreed to
in Alaska over the summer,

00:15:56.755 --> 00:15:58.891
which would involve
Ukraine handing over parts of the country

00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:01.460
that Russia hasn't been able to capture
even after four years of war.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.196
But then you have Zelensky,
who has consistently said that Ukraine's

00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:07.566
territorial integrity must be upheld
in any peace deal to end the war,

00:16:07.566 --> 00:16:11.036
all while you experts at the Institute
for the Study of War arguing that Putin

00:16:11.036 --> 00:16:14.573
is just using these latest talks to stall
for time and stave off additional U.S.

00:16:14.573 --> 00:16:17.643
sanctions, as he's done many times before,
though I will say here that

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:20.713
the hope is that he may become more
willing to compromise as his troops.

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:24.283
They just continue to pay a massive,
massive toll for shockingly little gain.

00:16:24.383 --> 00:16:27.386
Well, neither side has publicly disclosed
comprehensive casualty figures,

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:30.689
according to a new analysis by the center
for Strategic and International Studies,

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:33.225
the number of Russian troops killed
since the beginning of the war

00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:36.795
is around 415,000,
and the number of the overall casualties,

00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:40.933
including those wounded or missing,
that's around 1.2 million people,

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:42.968
which,
like I said, is more than any conflict

00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:44.737
Russia has been a part of since World
War two.

00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:45.004
I mean, it's

00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:49.041
more than 17 times greater than Soviet
losses in Afghanistan during the 1980s,

00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:52.244
11 times greater than during Russia's
First and Second Chechen wars,

00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:53.245
and five times greater

00:16:53.245 --> 00:16:56.315
than all Russian and Soviet wars combined
since the Second World War.

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:59.551
With all that, well, Russia
now occupies around 20% of Ukraine.

00:16:59.551 --> 00:17:01.887
It's been advancing at a snail's pace
for more than a year.

00:17:01.887 --> 00:17:03.288
I mean, since the start of 2024,

00:17:03.288 --> 00:17:06.992
they have reportedly only taken
another 1.5% of Ukraine's territory,

00:17:06.992 --> 00:17:10.863
advancing at an average rate of between 15
and 70m per day in their most high

00:17:10.863 --> 00:17:11.797
profile offensives.

00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:12.765
That is slower than almost

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:15.968
any major offensive campaign
in any war in the last century.

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:17.970
Which is why, with that,
you have one of the authors of the study

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:18.837
saying Russia's poor

00:17:18.837 --> 00:17:21.840
battlefield performance in Ukraine
and declining economic productivity

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.310
indicates that Russia is in serious
decline as a major power, while

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:29.281
Russia still possesses nuclear weapons
and a large military, it is no longer

00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:33.385
a great power in most military, economic
or science and technological categories.

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:33.986
But of course, you know,

00:17:33.986 --> 00:17:36.522
one of the big things here is
even if Russia is getting weaker,

00:17:36.522 --> 00:17:38.524
Ukraine is not doing so hot
either, with the center

00:17:38.524 --> 00:17:42.461
as being the between 100,000 and 140,000
Ukrainian soldiers have died so far,

00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:45.631
which puts Ukraine's overall casualty
number at around 600,000.

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:49.168
And then actually combined
the total is 1.8 million,

00:17:49.168 --> 00:17:52.037
which apparently means we're on track
for more than 2 million by spring.

00:17:52.037 --> 00:17:54.273
But also,
despite Russia bearing the brunt of that,

00:17:54.273 --> 00:17:57.443
its troops still outnumber Ukrainians
in fighting by almost 3 to 1.

00:17:57.443 --> 00:17:58.710
And that's in addition to Russia,
of course,

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.346
having a bigger population
to draw from to replenish their ranks.

00:18:01.346 --> 00:18:03.348
In fact,
Russia has seemingly kept its troop levels

00:18:03.348 --> 00:18:05.617
pretty much steady
throughout the war, though to do so,

00:18:05.617 --> 00:18:07.553
they've had to kind of pull out
all the stops.

00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:10.222
Russia has had to carry out
its first draft since World War two,

00:18:10.222 --> 00:18:10.622
and it's

00:18:10.622 --> 00:18:14.026
also offering massive financial incentives
to almost anyone who will enlist.

00:18:14.059 --> 00:18:17.596
So in one region, for example,
you can apparently get $50,000 in bonuses,

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:19.998
which is more than twice
the average annual income in the region.

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:22.701
And then in addition to that, you know,
we know as many as 15,000

00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:25.137
North Korean troops have fought alongside
Russian forces.

00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:29.041
In fact, citizens of Nepal, Kenya, South
Africa and Iraq are among those

00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:30.843
who have taken part, though
some have reported

00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:33.912
being tricked into coming to Russia
by trafficking groups offering jobs.

00:18:33.912 --> 00:18:35.080
Also, there have been reports

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.283
that raids have been carried out in areas
where migrants typically live or work

00:18:38.283 --> 00:18:40.152
in order
to pressure them into military service.

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:41.920
And actually, in November,
you had Putin making it

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.722
so that military service is mandatory

00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:46.892
for certain foreigners seeking
permanent residency while laws have also

00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:49.928
been adopted offering Fast-Track
Russian citizenship for enlistees.

00:18:49.928 --> 00:18:52.998
So we know that when an independent
Russian news site, together with a BBC

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:53.832
and some volunteers

00:18:53.832 --> 00:18:57.936
collected the names of over 160,000 troops
killed, they found that more than 550

00:18:57.936 --> 00:18:59.671
were foreigners
from over two dozen countries.

00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:02.975
Right now, that is, any troop
that wants out might face a worse fate.

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:05.410
There's a video going around right now
that alleges to show two

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:08.547
men who have been tied to trees
and tortured for deserting and failing

00:19:08.547 --> 00:19:09.281
to follow orders.

00:19:09.281 --> 00:19:11.650
And while that specific clip
hasn't been independently verified,

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.218
it is consistent with some other reporting

00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:14.786
that we've seen from independent
Russian media.

00:19:14.786 --> 00:19:17.823
And speaking of alleged Russian crimes,
you actually just had a Russian drone

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:20.826
hitting a Ukrainian passenger train
with more than 200 people on board.

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:22.127
You get the authorities
reporting afterward

00:19:22.127 --> 00:19:24.129
that they found fragments of five bodies.

00:19:24.129 --> 00:19:26.665
And Zelensky has condemned the attack
as an act of terrorism.

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:28.634
Also, strikes on the southern port
city of Odessa

00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:30.903
reportedly killed
three people and injured dozens more.

00:19:30.903 --> 00:19:32.371
And in the key region,
they killed two people,

00:19:32.371 --> 00:19:35.307
a couple leaving their four year
old child injured and orphaned.

00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:37.276
And all of that, of course, is
millions have been left

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:39.144
without heating, electricity and water

00:19:39.144 --> 00:19:41.246
because of Russian attacks
targeting energy infrastructure.

00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:43.081
And then also,
I mean, even beyond all that, there are

00:19:43.081 --> 00:19:44.716
these ways
that Russia is trying to wear down

00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:45.951
Ukraine, that we don't see

00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:49.087
one of them being how it's recruiting
teenagers were acts of sabotage.

00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:52.891
But Ukrainian officials have reportedly
identified around 1400 sabotage operations

00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:56.762
linked to Russian intelligence services
over the past two years, including 820,

00:19:56.762 --> 00:20:00.299
25.25 of those who were arrested
there were below the age of 18,

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:01.800
and many of those teens
were reportedly recruited

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.101
by Russian intelligence agencies

00:20:03.101 --> 00:20:05.604
through messages on telegram
and other social media channels.

00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:08.073
And so one of these people, for example,
they were offered $2,500

00:20:08.073 --> 00:20:10.475
just to pick up a package
and drop it off at a police station.

00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:12.344
But inside was an explosive.

00:20:12.344 --> 00:20:13.145
And that, as it turns out,

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:16.281
was actually built by four local boys
between the ages of 14 and 16.

00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:18.750
Luckily, the authorities handled
the situation before it was detonated.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.886
Now, with all that said,
you know, the Russian authorities

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:23.889
have also alleged that many teens
there have been recruited to carry out

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:26.658
acts of sabotage as well,
but they've rarely offered evidence.

00:20:26.658 --> 00:20:29.695
And so ultimately, that's kind of a
snapshot of where we are right now.

00:20:29.695 --> 00:20:30.829
We're gonna have to see where it goes.

00:20:30.829 --> 00:20:32.798
But then the last thing
I want to talk about today

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:34.933
is it's completely unrelated,
but it's been very interesting

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:37.336
to to look at
and also look at the fallout here.

00:20:37.336 --> 00:20:39.771
Candace Owens just leaked some audio,
and it's audio

00:20:39.771 --> 00:20:41.506
that's had a lot of people online
saying that.

00:20:41.506 --> 00:20:44.576
Erica Kirk sounds thrilled to be profiting
off her husband's death, right.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.846
Because Candace shared a clip of
what she claims is Erica speaking to TPO

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.283
staff following Charlie's memorial
just under two weeks after he died?

00:20:51.283 --> 00:20:52.517
And in this clip, it sounds like she's

00:20:52.517 --> 00:20:54.186
thanking them for their work
during the event.

00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:55.954
Discussing the future of TP USA.

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:58.991
And it's gotten more and more attention
because Candace, in a ton of others,

00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:02.127
have listened to that and said, you know,
it sounds like Erica is a little happier

00:21:02.127 --> 00:21:02.894
than you might assume.

00:21:02.894 --> 00:21:04.863
I don't even know where to begin.

00:21:04.863 --> 00:21:07.532
The fact that we were able to pull off

00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:11.169
an event

00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:14.072
of essentially like, it's just insane.

00:21:14.072 --> 00:21:18.343
We had over 275,000 people

00:21:18.877 --> 00:21:21.880
that attended and

00:21:22.214 --> 00:21:24.449
stadium overflow.

00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:29.655
I think we're at like over 200,000
for merch sales.

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:32.658
Again, it's not not easy, but.

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:36.194
I can appreciate

00:21:36.194 --> 00:21:38.196
it's hard.

00:21:38.196 --> 00:21:40.499
Otherwise honestly, turning Point

00:21:40.499 --> 00:21:43.502
USA and turning point action on

00:21:43.502 --> 00:21:46.471
the full steam ahead, you guys, we have

00:21:46.705 --> 00:21:49.708
Charlie would want us to get back to work,
and that's what we're doing.

00:21:49.708 --> 00:21:54.780
We have so much to do, which is exciting.

00:21:56.415 --> 00:22:00.686
Charlie in Heaven is like,
you guys thought you had a busy schedule.

00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:02.120
Then just you wait,

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.624
and he's doing some awesome things
with Jesus and heaven right now.

00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:07.793
But there's so much work to be done.

00:22:07.793 --> 00:22:11.830
I mean, since his assassination,

00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:15.000
we have 100,000

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.703
chapter, 100,000 chapter requests.

00:22:17.703 --> 00:22:20.605
We have 300,000 new donors.

00:22:20.605 --> 00:22:24.743
I think we have 50,000
plus had orders to fulfill.

00:22:24.776 --> 00:22:27.245
And Candace's reactions to Erica's
telling here was it.

00:22:27.245 --> 00:22:29.881
Is the general tone that is off putting.

00:22:29.881 --> 00:22:31.550
It's the laughter that is off putting.

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.752
It's again, we are not even two weeks

00:22:33.752 --> 00:22:35.454
after watching your husband
be assassinated.

00:22:35.454 --> 00:22:37.022
In my imagination,

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.592
I don't I just thought

00:22:40.592 --> 00:22:43.562
she would be more upset.

00:22:43.562 --> 00:22:45.731
We've seen as a lot of people,
both in and out of her

00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:49.534
audience, agreeing with Candace's take,
slamming Erica for sounding so excited and

00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:51.803
happy about merch sales
in the wake of her husband's murder,

00:22:51.803 --> 00:22:53.438
writing things like,
I can't imagine sounding

00:22:53.438 --> 00:22:55.974
like there's 11 days after
my husband was just publicly executed.

00:22:55.974 --> 00:22:57.843
No way
I would be thinking about merch sales.

00:22:57.843 --> 00:22:59.678
But then also where I understand
you had plenty of people

00:22:59.678 --> 00:23:02.247
defending Kirk, saying,
you know, everyone grieves differently

00:23:02.247 --> 00:23:03.448
and this didn't feel weird to them.

00:23:03.448 --> 00:23:06.151
Another saying that if anything, it shows
that Erica is stepping up

00:23:06.151 --> 00:23:09.721
as CEO of TP, USA, and the audio sounded
like a normal business meeting.

00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:12.257
And with that, you also saw
a lot of people taking aim at Candace,

00:23:12.257 --> 00:23:13.425
including one user who wrote,

00:23:13.425 --> 00:23:16.495
I find it disgusting that Candace Owens
keeps going after Erica.

00:23:16.495 --> 00:23:20.265
Erica obviously wants Charlie's legacy
to grow, saying she is doing what he would

00:23:20.265 --> 00:23:21.266
have wanted her to.

00:23:21.266 --> 00:23:22.234
She will carry on

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:24.403
and he also accusing Candace
of being hypocritical,

00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:26.772
saying she herself has been profiting off
of Kirk's death

00:23:26.772 --> 00:23:29.775
by posting countless videos,
milking his assassination, spreading

00:23:29.775 --> 00:23:32.511
conspiracy theories in the wake
of his death, and going after his widow.

00:23:32.511 --> 00:23:33.378
For now, we'll have to continue

00:23:33.378 --> 00:23:35.414
to see how this plays out
in the court of public opinion.

00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:38.450
As obviously, you know, for months now,
we've seen right wingers kind of going

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:41.052
after each other on different things,
as well as to wait and see

00:23:41.052 --> 00:23:43.555
if TP USA pushes back against Candace
here. Right.

00:23:43.555 --> 00:23:45.624
Because so far
they've kind of been pretty selective

00:23:45.624 --> 00:23:47.192
about what they respond to
when it comes to her.

00:23:47.192 --> 00:23:49.194
But that my friends,
you beautiful bastards, is

00:23:49.194 --> 00:23:51.763
where your Wednesday Philip DeFranco show
dive into the news is going to end.

00:23:51.763 --> 00:23:53.365
Well, of course
we'll see it right back here tomorrow

00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:54.866
with another daily dive into the news.

00:23:54.866 --> 00:23:56.334
There's more you can watch right now,

00:23:56.334 --> 00:23:58.603
because I also just uploaded
today's brand new podcast,

00:23:58.603 --> 00:24:00.439
Crashing Out with myself
and Alex Pearlman.

00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:02.307
I think we get the Don't Tread on Me
flag now.

00:24:02.307 --> 00:24:03.675
Apparently they didn't fucking believe it.

00:24:03.675 --> 00:24:05.177
I want it just be just real fast.

00:24:05.177 --> 00:24:08.180
I'm getting rev now I did.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:12.350
Sometimes you go to places and you're
like, oh, they invented bigotry here.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:15.654
I have not said anything else
that I can't prove in court.

00:24:15.654 --> 00:24:16.922
She made a movie with a man

00:24:16.922 --> 00:24:19.991
whose pictures in the FC files
and it's not her husband.

00:24:20.025 --> 00:24:21.293
Nobody gives a. Shit.

00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:21.726
What about you?

00:24:21.726 --> 00:24:24.062
Come to Georgia.
We go to the screening this Friday.

00:24:24.062 --> 00:24:25.130
We do a movie review.
