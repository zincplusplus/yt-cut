00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.768
Sup, you beautiful bastards.

00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:03.303
Welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show.

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:05.071
You daily dive into the news.

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:05.839
It is Monday.

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.874
I hope you're having a fantastic
President's Day.

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:10.610
Actually, if you are a president
who happens to be watching the show

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.912
and you're not in the Epstein files,
I hope you having a fantastic one.

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:15.782
I know that sounds like a pretty low bar
not being in the Epstein files,

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.250
but it is 2026 and the bar is

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.752
not just low, it is not just underground.

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.520
The bar is in hell, but on that

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.055
cheery note,
I do have some good news for you.

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.591
Well, other, dare I say lesser daily news

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:26.026
shows are taking the holiday off

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.227
the Philip DeFranco show.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.094
It's doubling down.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:29.462
You can get filled in twice today.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:30.630
I think your mom calls a deep.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:31.831
And it's
because right after you finish this

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.400
full Philip DeFranco show, you can watch

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.734
or listen to my brand new podcast

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.069
and interview with Adam Freedland.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:37.470
Coming home is one of the most interesting

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.872
interviewers of the past few years.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.273
Others know him as a bug,

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:41.908
and even if you don't know him,
I think you're going to love it.

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:43.610
So I got a link in the description down
below.

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:45.045
With all that said, we've got a lot

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.846
to talk about today, starting with this.

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:48.381
The Department of Homeland Security
is subpoena

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:49.983
and Google, meta, Reddit

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:51.251
and discord to dox people

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:52.652
who criticized Ice online.

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:54.154
And the tech companies are complaining.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.588
According to the New York Times, DHS

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:57.690
has been quietly issuing subpoenas
to tech platforms

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.726
demanding names, emails, phone numbers

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:01.795
and other personal user data breakdowns
that either

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:03.363
pointed to Ice agent locations

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:04.664
or just criticized Ice online.

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:06.800
And again, the platforms
targeted were Google, Reddit,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.235
discord, and meta, which is Facebook
and Instagram, and every platform

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.570
except discord has complied

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.805
with at least some of the requests.

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:13.473
And this is happening
while Ice is simultaneously

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:15.141
using facial recognition technology,

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:16.910
and protesters in Minneapolis and Chicago

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:18.511
using a Palantir built database

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.914
to identify real time locations
or people that they're pursuing,

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:22.415
and using tools that potentially

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:23.616
allow them to hack into phones.

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:24.818
You even at borders, are Tom home

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:27.053
and telling Fox News last month
what the end game is.

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:28.354
We will create a database

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.824
where those people
are arrested for interference,

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:33.526
and so we will make them famous, move

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:35.228
and put their face on TV.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.331
We're going to let their employers
in their neighborhoods

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:40.467
and their schools
know who these people are.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.802
Now with this, you've got the times
reporting that some companies notified

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.170
targeted users and gave them 10

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.106
to 14 days
to fight the subpoenas in court.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.307
And you have DHS saying that

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:49.109
it's only doing this to keep Haven safe.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.911
And while you've many calling BS on that,
we also need to talk about the type

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:54.481
of subpoena being used here,
because historically it's been deployed

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:55.915
very rarely, mainly for cases

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:57.350
like catching child traffickers,

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:58.618
because these are administrative

00:01:58.618 --> 00:01:59.919
subpoenas, unlike arrest warrants,

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:01.254
they don't require a judge's signature.

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:03.756
And DHS can just issue them
directly to Trump's DHS.

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:05.091
They love using them.

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:05.692
They always have it.

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:07.093
Back in 2017, DHS

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:09.329
tried to expose an anonymous Twitter user
as critical of Trump's

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.798
first administration
and then in Trump 2.0 last year.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.233
They use them against many accounts,

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.301
posting updates
about Ice raids in California

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.704
and accounts documenting Ice sightings
outside of Philadelphia.

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:19.439
Now, each case
eventually made it to court,

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.174
but DHS withdrew all of them

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:22.442
before any rulings were made.

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:23.610
Well, that might sound confusing.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.178
You are the ACLU explaining why

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:27.113
a judge's order stopping the practice

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:28.548
grand the tactic entirely, right.

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:29.916
But if DHS pulls a subpoena

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:31.718
before that happens,
they can just keep going.

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:33.019
And as one ACLU lawyer

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.455
explained,
not everyone who gets subpoenaed will sue,

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:37.023
saying the pressure is on the end

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:38.858
user, the private individual,
to go to court.

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:40.960
Obviously, with this whole situation,
there's been pushback.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.495
And one of the ways
we've seen that play out is

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:43.730
you had representative O'Connor,

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.031
who represents Silicon Valley,

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:46.399
saying tech must not bend

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.734
the knee to a surveillance state.

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:50.136
Google, meta and other companies
should refuse to comply

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:52.472
with administrative subpoenas
that target anonymous speech

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:53.840
critical of Ice is a blatant

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.141
violation of the First Amendment.

00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:56.476
But the problem with that is, as we've

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:58.811
seen, tech
now loves bending the knee to MAGA.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:00.346
One of the best examples
we've seen is meta

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.581
CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:02.982
He's been cozying up to Trump.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:04.517
He killed Fact-checking on his platforms,

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.819
and he justified it by echoing
Trump's talking point,

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.054
saying that Meta's content

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:09.589
moderation resulted in censorship.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:12.192
He also famously donated at Trump's
second inauguration.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.593
Amazon and Google did as well,

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:16.462
and combined they donated more than double
what they donated during Biden

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:17.664
and Trump's first inauguration.

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:19.299
Then, of course, you've got TikTok,
which is owned

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.533
by Oracle, run by Larry

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:21.834
Ellison, a Trump ally,

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.403
and then Twitter,
you know, Trump and Elon,

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:24.637
they might fight here and there.

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:27.106
But Elon is still very much aligned
with the MAGA camp.

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:29.275
Also, with this whole situation,
we need to go back to discord

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:30.610
because you have people connecting these

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.145
anti subpoenas to Discord's

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:33.713
announcement
last week that it's rolling out

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:35.748
new age
verification features beginning in March,

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:36.983
because those features include

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:38.985
using a government issued ID, a discord.

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.620
They try to assure users that uploading

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.988
IDs is actually optional,

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:43.323
and that they only look at age

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:44.891
and then immediately
delete the information.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.859
Whether you deep dive or you just skim.

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.194
You see people are not buying that.

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:49.562
And that's including tons of notable

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:50.930
creators sounding the alarm.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.265
So, you know,
there was a time where all this,

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:53.466
like surveillance state

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:54.667
talk felt like

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:56.603
outlandish conspiracy theories.

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:57.971
But like I said, it's it's

00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:00.340
hard to ignore it
when it's so in our face these days.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.242
And it's so obvious because everyone

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:03.876
is shitting on this instead

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:05.912
of, like, defending their users,

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:07.380
like the people that put them

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.848
in this position to begin with.

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:10.383
The, it's like they're

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:12.819
turning in their surveillance
state homework early.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:13.720
This is despicable.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.022
And getting everyone more
and more comfortable

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:18.625
with mass surveillance and no privacy.

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:20.893
Turning over your information and data

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:23.796
is something that tons of companies
are doing everything

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:25.131
in their power to do.

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:26.766
They just found a convenient

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.568
excuse to try and paint it

00:04:28.568 --> 00:04:31.237
as something good, like protecting

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:34.007
kids from bad people on discord.

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:35.775
And this is valuable

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:37.076
information to tie to your ID

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:38.511
and your online presence,

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:39.712
or attaching ideas

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:41.514
to everything bears with it.

00:04:41.514 --> 00:04:44.217
We think serious risks of one exposure,

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:45.885
as in just vulnerabilities

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:47.186
to different types of attacks

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:48.388
extortion, blackmail,

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:50.790
but also future suppression of speech

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.060
such as via corporations
and or governments.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.062
Right now, we are at a pivotal point

00:04:56.362 --> 00:04:58.431
that unless you speak against this shit

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:00.066
and if you let it happen,

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:01.934
if you don't raise awareness to it now,

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:03.369
the world will look

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:06.105
very different in the next five,
maybe ten years.

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:08.708
Writing reports actually indicate
that in the UK, some users have been

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:10.276
alerted that they're part of an experiment

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:11.544
with persona, an age

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:13.012
verification vendor whose investors

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:15.381
include Peter Thiel,
the co-founder of Palantir,

00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:18.084
the company building the database
to surveil people that ISIS pursuing.

00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:20.286
Discord's own tweet announcing the feature

00:05:20.286 --> 00:05:22.722
got community note with a note saying,
well, initially, discord

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:24.390
may have never sent your data
to their vendor

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.459
after failure of the system
being shown e.g.

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:28.861
face scan bypasses,
they are swapping vendors

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:30.296
to persona who does in fact

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:31.597
receive and retain your data.

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:33.566
Persona is also funded by Peter Thiel.

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:34.500
Discord line.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.269
Now, there's been no official confirmation

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:38.905
that discord is coordinating
with DHS to spy on users,

00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:40.273
but people are understandably

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:42.709
cautious because, well, Trump's DHS,
they will go to hell

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:44.777
and back to keep their agents identities
protected.

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.913
The average American,
you might be out of luck,

00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:48.715
especially if you're not on their side,
though.

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:50.783
Also,
we have to talk about on the note to DHS,

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:52.018
they officially shut down

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.252
Saturday morning after Congress

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:54.787
failed to pass a funding deal, though

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:56.723
I will say the agency isn't going dark.

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:58.624
Rather,
the shutdown is more selective than that

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:01.427
because Senate Democrats blocked
a spending bill that would have funded DHS

00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:02.895
through the fiscal year, with them arguing

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:04.364
that it didn't include new restrictions

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:05.565
on federal immigration agents

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:08.401
and even Democrats calling
for what they say are simple, commonsense

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:10.203
reforms mandating search warrants,

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:11.938
requiring agents to wear identification,

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.606
prohibiting officers from wearing masks

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:15.408
and establishing universal use of force

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:16.743
standards, with party leadership

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:18.010
also rejecting a last minute

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.313
white House counteroffer
that wasn't made public, with Senate

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:21.814
Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemning

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:23.816
it as not serious. Plain and simple.

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:25.218
Now, Republicans have blamed Democrats

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:26.519
for the funding lapse, accusing them

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.020
of making unreasonable demands

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.089
and failing
to provide enough time for negotiations.

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:31.391
You've also had other is countering that.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.393
It was pretty obvious that this was needed

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:34.660
after the killing of Alex Brady.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.729
That was a key, pivotal moment
that changed things.

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:37.964
Now, again, this shutdown, it

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:39.265
only affects DHS, right?

00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:40.466
Though
the rest of the government, it's already

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:41.834
been funded
through the end of the fiscal year.

00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:43.035
And really, this partial shutdown became

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:44.270
inevitable after the Senate failed

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.172
to break the 60 vote
filibuster on Thursday,

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:47.373
with every single Democrat

00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:49.142
voting against the bill
except John Fetterman,

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:51.511
who's basically become a dino Democrat
in name only.

00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:53.246
And actually,
unlike with other funding showdowns,

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.581
there was no last minute rush
to find a solution on Friday,

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:58.284
with senators on both sides
packing their bags and leaving D.C.

00:06:58.284 --> 00:06:59.485
now with that, both Schumer and Senate

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:01.721
Majority Leader
John Thune said that senators will return

00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:03.122
from their weeklong recess early

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:04.924
if a deal is struck, but it's also unclear

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:07.260
when that will happen on Thursday,
with Boone telling reporters

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.761
that negotiations between the white House

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.062
and Democrats were making progress,

00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:12.565
and he believed that a deal
was still possible with more time.

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:15.268
But he also maintained that Democrats
would have to make concessions,

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.637
saying Democrats are never going
to get their full wish list.

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:19.005
That's not the way this works

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.807
as far as what Republicans want
or are willing

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:22.875
to give up, their remains unclear
since the White House's

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:24.310
counteroffer hasn't been made public.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.778
But you did have Boone saying that

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:27.113
he expects that the white House's demands

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:28.314
will include new protections

00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:31.017
for federal immigration agents
and restrictions on sanctuary cities.

00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:32.418
But then with that,
you have some Democrats

00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:34.220
saying
that they don't want to offer concessions

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.255
that could undermine the guardrails
that they're trying to impose.

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:37.490
And so right now, it looks like this

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.858
partial shutdown could drag on,

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:40.226
which is why
we need to talk about the impact.

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:41.828
And with that, you've got DHS leaders
saying

00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:43.863
that essential missions
and functions will continue.

00:07:43.863 --> 00:07:45.331
And actually, despite that this being

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:46.699
the whole reason for the shutdown,

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:49.569
Ice and CBP will hardly be affected
because Republicans

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.804
gave the agency billions of dollars
in the big beautiful bill.

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:53.739
Their operations will barely be impacted.

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:55.708
It's actually
the other agencies under DHS.

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:58.644
They're going to be hit the hardest
TSA, FEMA, and the Coast Guard.

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:00.980
So this is affecting 13%
of the federal workforce directly.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.482
And while DHS has not publicly released

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:05.184
an updated shutdown plan, its last plan,
which is from September,

00:08:05.184 --> 00:08:07.086
it indicates that 91% of employees

00:08:07.086 --> 00:08:08.521
will continue working without pay.

00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:10.022
I'll see you've got the DHS inspector

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:11.724
general warning
that the shutdown could endanger

00:08:11.724 --> 00:08:12.992
immigration enforcement oversight,

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:15.027
because the independent watchdog
currently has eight

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:17.630
active probes into the Trump
administration's immigration crackdown.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.998
But the office says
that it's going to be forced

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.867
to suspend 85% of its audits,

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:22.301
evaluations and inspections

00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:23.536
and also the American people.

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:24.837
They could be directly affected as well.

00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:26.372
While 95% of TSA

00:08:26.372 --> 00:08:27.740
employees are required to work during

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.108
a shutdown, still have experts warning

00:08:29.108 --> 00:08:31.644
that there is a risk of airport delays
if this drags on,

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:33.446
and the acting TSA administrator warned

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:36.148
that the public could start seeing impacts
in as little as two weeks.

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:37.416
And so, you know, with all of that,
there's a lot

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:38.951
they're going to have to keep our eyes on
for at least

00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:40.353
the coming days and weeks.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.488
And then there's more
we're going to dive into in just a minute.

00:08:42.488 --> 00:08:44.090
But first, let me thank the sponsor
and say, you know,

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.559
there are things that I'll put off forever
if given the chance.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:48.828
Doctor appointments
definitely high on that list right now

00:08:48.828 --> 00:08:50.329
because, you know,
I don't care about my health.

00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:52.832
It's more
the process is annoying and it's slow

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:54.300
and it feels way harder than it should be.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.801
But that is also why today's sponsor,

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:57.169
Zantac, is now my move.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.839
Hot dogs, a free app and website
that helps you find and book high

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:01.140
quality in-network doctors

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.341
so you can find someone that you love.

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:05.144
I'm talking
primary care dentists, dermatologists, eye

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:06.679
doctors, therapists basically over

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.281
200 specialties all in one place.

00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:10.950
You can also filter by insurance,
location, specialty,

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.985
and whether you want an in-person
or video visit

00:09:12.985 --> 00:09:14.487
so you're not rolling
the dice on your health.

00:09:14.487 --> 00:09:16.856
You also get access
to verified patient reviews, so

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:18.224
you're not rolling the dice on someone

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:19.725
who makes you feel rushed or weird.

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:21.594
And the best part? Real time availability.

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:23.396
You can see open slots and book instantly.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.764
No calls, no voicemails, no.

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:26.032
We'll get back to you and appointments.

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:27.533
Book the doc typically happen

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:29.101
within 24 to 72 hours

00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:30.703
and same day slots are often available.

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:32.338
I've used it, I still use it,

00:09:32.338 --> 00:09:34.974
and I can book an appointment
faster than I can talk myself out of it.

00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:36.342
So stop putting off those doctor's

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:37.743
appointments and scan the QR code.

00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:40.046
Or go to zoc doc.com/fill

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:41.280
to find an instantly book.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.318

Zacks.com fill this message is sponsored

00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:49.355
by Zap doc.

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:51.991
But then next up today
we've got to talk about how

00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:53.459
there is a secret civil war

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:55.628
happening inside of the Department
of Homeland Security,

00:09:55.661 --> 00:09:57.196
and it involves an alleged affair,

00:09:57.196 --> 00:09:58.631
a fired pilot over a missing

00:09:58.631 --> 00:10:00.499
blanket, a guy dodging federal ethics

00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:02.902
rules by not swiping his badge,
and a cabinet secretary

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:04.470
apparently more focused on our TV

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.972
airtime than running the department

00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:07.440
was, according to a bombshell Wall Street

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.874
Journal report based on two dozen

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:10.209
current and former officials.

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:12.144
There's a deep
and very real internal conflict

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:13.579
at DHS between two factions.

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:15.114
One side you apparently have borders

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:16.649
are Tom Homan and Acting Ice

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:18.050
director Todd Lyons, who favor

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.785
a more traditional, targeted enforcement

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:21.220
approach focused on actual criminals.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.989
And on the other side,
you have DHS Secretary

00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:25.424
Kristi Noem and her top
adviser, Corey Lewandowski,

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:27.860
who were her flashy,
attention grabbing operations.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.428
They're the kind kind of made for great

00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:31.297
TV, but, the critics argue, terrorize

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:33.933
migrants indiscriminately
and ultimately undermine the mission.

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:35.401
And you had multiple officials
telling the Journal

00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:36.869
that Noem has repeatedly been warned

00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:38.804
that these tactics
would discredit the department.

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:39.705
But she didn't listen.

00:10:39.705 --> 00:10:40.906
White House
officials have reportedly grown

00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:42.608
frustrated that Noem and Lewandowski

00:10:42.608 --> 00:10:44.377
have rejected guidance on events,

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:47.313
messaging and basic agency management,
with several senior officials

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:48.881
describing DHS as the single

00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:50.416
biggest headache of Trump's second term.

00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:52.118
But also don't understand how we got here.

00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:53.486
You need to understand these two are.

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:54.920
The windows key is reportedly
part of the reason

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.123
that no one became
DHS secretary in the first place.

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:58.457
Despite having minimal experience

00:10:58.457 --> 00:11:00.426
in immigration enforcement,
he quietly lobbied for her

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:03.162
to get the post, took her to work vans
with Republican powerbrokers,

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:04.664
introduced her as a rising star,

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.332
try to get her picked as Trump's VP,

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.401
and when that didn't work,
he pushed for Homeland Security.

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:10.670
Instead,
he reportedly saw DHS as a launchpad

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.105
for a potential gnome 2028
presidential run.

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:15.841
And then also, there is the personal side
of this the Daily Mail.

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:17.343
They published photos of Lewandowski

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:20.012
carrying a duffel bag and going back
and forth between his apartment

00:11:20.012 --> 00:11:21.414
and Gnome's apartment across the street.

00:11:21.414 --> 00:11:22.615
When people started asking questions,

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:24.517
know moved into a government
owned waterfront house

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.986
on a military base in Washington,
citing security concerns.

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:27.620
Reportedly.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.989
Wouldn't you know
it, Lewandowski spends time there, too.

00:11:29.989 --> 00:11:31.924
I'll see you got sources saying
they've been traveling together

00:11:31.924 --> 00:11:33.192
on a luxury 737

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:34.527
Max jet with a private cabin.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:35.961
And within the department, it's widely

00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:38.397
considered an open secret
that they're in a relationship with that.

00:11:38.397 --> 00:11:39.598
To be clear, both Noem

00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:40.833
and Lewandowski are married,

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:42.601
and they both deny
that there is an affair.

00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:44.437
Apparently, even Trump
doesn't buy that denial.

00:11:44.437 --> 00:11:46.639
Or when Lewandowski
asked to formally serve as Nome's

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:47.873
chief of staff, Trump said no,

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:49.442
reportedly citing the alleged romance.

00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:50.943
And he's apparently continued
to bring it up.

00:11:50.943 --> 00:11:53.446
And so, instead of chief of staff,
Lewandowski took the title

00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:54.780
of special government employee,

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.215
essentially a federal ethics

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:57.817
loophole designed to allow private sector

00:11:57.817 --> 00:11:59.852
experts
to work on specific government projects

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:02.121
without giving up their outside
salaries and business interests.

00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:03.989
And if that sounds familiar,
you recognize the title.

00:12:03.989 --> 00:12:06.092
It's the same one
that Elon Musk held at Doge.

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:07.860
And so with that,
you might remember that the catch is

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.061
you can only use that designation

00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:10.396
for 130 days per year.

00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:12.031
Lewandowski
reportedly got around that limit

00:12:12.031 --> 00:12:14.033
by just not swiping in
at the DHS building.

00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:16.068
And reporting fewer days work
than he actually logged

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:17.369
to the white House counsel's office.

00:12:17.369 --> 00:12:19.105
So he's in the building,
influencing decisions,

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:20.439
but technically not there.

00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:21.774
And actually, with all this,
we should talk about

00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:23.242
the moment that perfectly encapsulate

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:24.443
how these two operate,

00:12:24.443 --> 00:12:25.778
because it's genuinely unbelievable.

00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:27.213
When no one's plane
had a maintenance issue,

00:12:27.213 --> 00:12:28.681
she had it switch to a backup aircraft.

00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:29.448
And her blanket.

00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:30.816
Yes, her personal blanket

00:12:30.816 --> 00:12:32.384
was not transferred to the new plane.

00:12:32.384 --> 00:12:35.154
I know, horrified
when that response was to fire

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:36.489
the pilot on the spot

00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:38.891
and then tell them to take
a commercial flight home when they landed.

00:12:38.924 --> 00:12:40.693
But then no one knew when she realized

00:12:40.693 --> 00:12:42.027
they had no one to fly them back,

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:43.662
and so they reinstated the pilot.

00:12:43.662 --> 00:12:45.464
But also beyond the drama
that the journal's reporting

00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:47.500
on actual governance
failures, it's significant.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.868
George's Republican governor, Brian Kemp,

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:50.469
office had to personally call top

00:12:50.469 --> 00:12:52.805
DHS aides
just to get disaster aid money approved,

00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:54.640
because it was inexplicably held
up, right?

00:12:54.673 --> 00:12:56.942
Even for some of Trump's favorite things,
there have been mess ups.

00:12:56.942 --> 00:12:58.744
Florida officials have struggled
to get federal funding

00:12:58.744 --> 00:13:01.380
for alligator, Alcatraz
and on Trump's own border wall.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.082
Reportedly, a contract for bulk steel

00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:05.885
sat on Noem's desk,
waiting for her signature for so long

00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:07.586
that by the time
that she finally signed it,

00:13:07.586 --> 00:13:08.854
the price of steel had gone up by more

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:10.122
than $100 million.

00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:11.357
Meanwhile, multiple officials

00:13:11.357 --> 00:13:12.691
told the Journal that contracts

00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:13.926
and grants under Lewandowski's

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:16.695
influence are being awarded in an opaque
and arbitrary manner.

00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:17.963
Some are also being held up

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:19.632
without explanation, and high level staff

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.901
have reportedly been instructed
to meet with specific companies

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:24.303
for services that other contractors
have previously handled.

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:25.771
Remember, as a special government

00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:28.207
employee, Lewandowski still has private
sector ties

00:13:28.207 --> 00:13:29.408
while also being involved in

00:13:29.408 --> 00:13:30.609
handing out those contracts.

00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:31.977
Right through all of this, Noem's

00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:33.412
apparently been waging an internal war

00:13:33.412 --> 00:13:35.080
against Tom Homan for TV airtime

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.482
and public visibility, with sources saying

00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:38.851
that she would berate staff
if she saw it on TV.

00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:40.753
She kept track of his screen
time to make sure

00:13:40.753 --> 00:13:43.355
that she was appearing more than him,
and on at least one occasion,

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:45.291
she asked aides to ensure
that she drew a bigger

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:46.725
crowd than home at a conference.

00:13:46.725 --> 00:13:48.260
And then when the Minnesota situation
blew up,

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:49.862
there was pressure
mounting for her firing.

00:13:49.862 --> 00:13:52.198
Lewandowski
reportedly messaged Trump's pollster Tony

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:53.432
Fabrizio, asking him

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:54.900
to cut an ad in Nome's defense,

00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:56.702
while Fabrizio apparently just ignored

00:13:56.702 --> 00:13:58.370
him and Trump resisted calls to fire her.

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.172
He did replace Noem and Lewandowski's

00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:01.640
ally Greg Bovino with Homan,

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:03.442
Nome's long term rival, essentially

00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:04.710
inserting her biggest internal

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:05.978
app into a more prominent role.

00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:08.447
In case you need a reminder of why
this matters, DHS

00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:10.683
is one of the most powerful departments
in the federal government,

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:12.151
and it sits at the center of Trump's

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:13.586
entire second term agenda. Right?

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:15.588
The idea that it's being run
by two people, allegedly

00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:16.922
circumventing ethics laws,

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:18.324
managing by intimidation,

00:14:18.324 --> 00:14:19.959
holding up disaster funding, costing

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:21.627
taxpayers over $100 million

00:14:21.627 --> 00:14:23.095
just through negligence and measuring

00:14:23.095 --> 00:14:24.430
success by TV screen time,

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:25.631
rather than actual outcomes.

00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:26.932
That's not just gossip

00:14:26.932 --> 00:14:28.200
that has real world

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.002
consequences for real world people.

00:14:30.002 --> 00:14:32.371
And the fact that this reporting
is coming from two dozen current

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:34.440
and former officials,
not anonymous political opponents,

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:36.041
that suggests that the dysfunction is

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:37.343
so severe that people

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:39.879
inside of the administration
are feeling compelled to speak out.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:42.715
But then next up, today, this sounds fake,
but it is real.

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:45.050
The Trump administration has spent
at least 40 million

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.852
of your taxpayer dollars to deport around

00:14:46.852 --> 00:14:48.520
300 people to countries

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.522
they're not even from,
and that includes those run

00:14:50.522 --> 00:14:52.892
by some of the world's
most corrupt and dangerous regimes.

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:53.025
Right.

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:54.894
Because we've talked a lot
about the nearly 250

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:56.428
Venezuelans that were sent to El Salvador

00:14:56.428 --> 00:14:58.831
and held in a brutal prison
known for human rights abuses.

00:14:58.831 --> 00:15:00.599
But did you also know that the white House

00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:02.735
paid nearly $5 million for that? Right.

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:04.136
They also paid Equatorial Guinea

00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:05.771
$7.5 million, an amount

00:15:05.771 --> 00:15:07.473
that reportedly exceeds all U.S.

00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:09.408
assistance
provided to the country over the previous

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:11.944
eight years, combined to accept 29 people.

00:15:11.944 --> 00:15:13.212
They're also paid as Whitney,

00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:15.814
$5.1 million for taking 15 people.

00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:19.118
A paid Rwanda $7.5
million was an estimated

00:15:19.118 --> 00:15:20.719
$600,000 in flight costs

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:21.987
to accept just seven people.

00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:23.389
To just do the math for you,
that works out

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:25.925
to about $1.1 million per person.

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:28.394
And also, notably
some countries have apparently been paid

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:29.528
in more creative ways.

00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:30.829
South Sudan, for example,

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:33.399
they reportedly requested sanctions
relief on government officials

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:35.167
as well as American investment in oil

00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:37.670
and gas in exchange for accepting
just eight deportees.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.904
Right as far as how we even know

00:15:38.904 --> 00:15:40.339
about this, it's all based on that

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:41.640
new report released by Democrats

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.975
in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:44.243
There's also a lot of this information

00:15:44.243 --> 00:15:46.578
is supported by outside
reporting and investigations.

00:15:46.578 --> 00:15:47.846
And this whole dumpster fire raises

00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:50.649
a lot of practical and moral questions
about the administration's practice

00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:52.952
of deporting immigrants
to so-called third countries,

00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:54.186
but with one key point being that more

00:15:54.186 --> 00:15:55.554
than 80% of the migrants sent

00:15:55.554 --> 00:15:57.456
to these third countries,
they've already returned

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:59.758
to their home nations,
or they're in the process of doing so.

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:01.193
So one of the questions that pops up
is, well,

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:03.262
why weren't
they deported there in the first place?

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:04.630
And, well, it turns out first off,

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.532
there's just sheer
fucking incompetence, right?

00:16:06.532 --> 00:16:09.034
The administration has defended
third country removals in the past

00:16:09.034 --> 00:16:10.636
by saying that, you know,
they have no choice

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.771
when the people they're deporting
are, quote, so uniquely

00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:15.174
barbaric that their own countries
won't take them back.

00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:17.743
But the report found multiple instances
in which home governments

00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:19.378
were willing to accept their citizens

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:20.612
or were never even properly

00:16:20.612 --> 00:16:22.081
contact you in court filings,

00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:23.482
for example, showing that Ice either

00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:25.951
didn't request travel documents
from home countries in the first place,

00:16:25.951 --> 00:16:27.252
or they failed to give governments

00:16:27.252 --> 00:16:28.921
enough time to process the paperwork.

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:30.122
Also, as far as the implication

00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:32.491
that these people are barbaric
and dangerous animals

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:33.993
and we don't have a lot of information,

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:35.761
but public records have purportedly shown
that at least

00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:38.097
some were never convicted of crimes
in the United States.

00:16:38.097 --> 00:16:40.499
That includes most of the Venezuelans
sent to El Salvador.

00:16:40.532 --> 00:16:41.800
Then moving on to the second reason

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.435
for all of this besides the incompetence,

00:16:43.435 --> 00:16:45.337
it may just be sheer fucking inhumanity

00:16:45.371 --> 00:16:47.172
because in some cases,
the administration actually isn't

00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:49.575
allowed to send people home,
so it seemingly just sends them

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:51.243
to one of these other countries
to get around the law.

00:16:51.243 --> 00:16:53.912
And actually,
since September of 2025, most migrants

00:16:53.912 --> 00:16:55.948
flown to third
countries had court ordered protections.

00:16:55.981 --> 00:16:58.250
So that means that the administration
was legally barred from

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.652
sending them back to their home countries
because there was a good chance

00:17:00.652 --> 00:17:02.621
they face persecution, torture or death

00:17:02.654 --> 00:17:04.423
when they send them to a third country.

00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:06.692
Many just end up being sent to their home
countries anyways.

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:07.393
Within days.

00:17:07.393 --> 00:17:09.495
So even a federal district
judge arguing in September.

00:17:09.495 --> 00:17:11.697
These actions
also appear to be part of a pattern

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:13.599
and widespread effort
to evade the government's

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.667
legal obligations by doing indirectly

00:17:15.667 --> 00:17:16.869
what it cannot do directly.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.570
Of course, if it can do it directly,

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:20.939
it will do it directly,
no matter how fucked up it is.

00:17:20.973 --> 00:17:23.042
So, for example, you're seeing things
like the administration

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:24.476
striking a deal with Iran to deport

00:17:24.476 --> 00:17:25.844
400 Iranian nationals,

00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:27.312
including Christian converts,

00:17:27.312 --> 00:17:28.981
ethnic minorities
and political dissidents.

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:31.617
And at least eight people
on the first flight reportedly begged

00:17:31.617 --> 00:17:33.485
not to be sent
because they feared for their lives,

00:17:33.485 --> 00:17:36.121
and one reportedly
said he attempted suicide at a U.S.

00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:37.356
detention facility in an attempt

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:40.225
to avoid being sent back to Iran,
but was still deported.

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:42.294
Well, also with this right, it's
not like these third countries

00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:44.163
that they're sending people
to are always safe either.

00:17:44.163 --> 00:17:46.532
Now, the El Salvador case, that might be
the best example of that, right?

00:17:46.532 --> 00:17:48.901
People were sent to a prison
where rights groups had before

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:50.235
and since documented credible

00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:52.404
reports of torture
and abuse think some countries,

00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:54.139
including Mexico and Vietnam, for example,

00:17:54.139 --> 00:17:55.541
they were temporarily held in converted

00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:56.909
shipping containers in Djibouti

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:58.343
before being sent to South Sudan,

00:17:58.444 --> 00:17:59.945
which is a country that our own State

00:17:59.945 --> 00:18:01.847
Department
currently has a level four travel

00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:03.182
warning for, saying that you shouldn't

00:18:03.182 --> 00:18:05.551
go there for any reason
due to risk of unrest,

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:07.953
crime,
kidnaping, land mines and health threats.

00:18:07.986 --> 00:18:10.122
So with that, you had one committee member
telling the Guardian,

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:11.490
this is a scare tactic for them

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:14.193
to be able to tell people here in the US,
if you don't self-deport,

00:18:14.193 --> 00:18:15.694
you could get sent to South Sudan,

00:18:15.727 --> 00:18:17.162
you get sent to Sabbatini

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:19.298
and going on to say,
we spent so much of last year

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:20.632
hearing how we have to cut

00:18:20.632 --> 00:18:22.134
waste, we have to cut spending.

00:18:22.134 --> 00:18:24.002
We're not spending millions of dollars

00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:25.370
on foreign assistance, on health

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.206
saving dollars
for child care and maternity,

00:18:27.206 --> 00:18:29.808
health and diseases
and epidemics and famine around the world.

00:18:29.808 --> 00:18:31.276
But we are spending it on this.

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:34.246
Despite how little fiscal sense
this seems to make, with studies

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:35.481
showing immigrants are a net

00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:36.715
benefit to the economy,

00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:39.418
this practice may only continue to grow,
but the Trump administration

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:40.919
is now reportedly pursuing third country

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:42.154
deportation agreements with at least

00:18:42.154 --> 00:18:43.522
47 other countries.

00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:45.023
And they're also negotiating agreements

00:18:45.023 --> 00:18:46.225
with countries that will accept US

00:18:46.225 --> 00:18:48.794
asylum seekers while their asylum
claims are processed now.

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.162
Also with this, while we could soon

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:52.064
see more people detained
outside of the country,

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:53.465
there are also obviously many still

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:55.067
being detained inside of the country.

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:57.903
One of the things that stands out is that
in addition to the overall numbers,

00:18:57.903 --> 00:18:59.805
the number of kids in federal custody,

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.907
it has skyrocketed
since Trump became president.

00:19:01.907 --> 00:19:03.842
And of course, it really shouldn't
be that surprising

00:19:03.842 --> 00:19:05.010
since he brought back the practice

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.612
of detaining entire immigrant families.

00:19:06.612 --> 00:19:07.813
But it's also we're talking about

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:09.982
because it may be as bad as many feared.

00:19:10.082 --> 00:19:12.284
The detention center,
where almost all of the hundreds of kids

00:19:12.284 --> 00:19:13.852
who have been locked up
have passed through

00:19:13.852 --> 00:19:15.420
as the massive facility in Texas,

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.989
which is about 70 miles south of San

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:18.857
Antonio, surrounded by barbed wire,

00:19:18.857 --> 00:19:21.193
most families sleep in rooms
shared with other families,

00:19:21.193 --> 00:19:23.462
and they've complained about inadequate
medical care,

00:19:23.462 --> 00:19:24.663
insufficient drinking water,

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:26.165
and a lack of schooling for their kids.

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:28.500
Some kids have also become suicidal
and had panic attacks,

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.002
according to families and their lawyers,

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:32.304
and in total, about 3500 adults and kids.

00:19:32.304 --> 00:19:34.540
They've passed through this place
and Trump reopened it last year.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.942
And many of these children who were sent
there, they've reportedly been living

00:19:36.942 --> 00:19:39.645
in the United States and attending
American schools, sometimes for years.

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:41.980
And while with that, you know,
technically they go to schools

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.650
at the detention facility,
apparently the education is lacking with,

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.652
for example, a 16 year old student
telling The New York Times

00:19:46.652 --> 00:19:48.053
that they have high school students

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:49.388
coloring in the American flag.

00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:51.456
You've got a lawyer
representing detained children saying

00:19:51.456 --> 00:19:52.991
you can make all sorts of improvements,

00:19:52.991 --> 00:19:54.359
but it's still going to be a prison.

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:56.161
You can improve education,
and they should,

00:19:56.161 --> 00:19:57.396
but it will still be a place

00:19:57.396 --> 00:19:58.830
with sick, sad children.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.098
Now, with all that, you've also had

00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:02.768
the DHS defending conditions
and the quality of the education

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:04.269
at the facility, while also saying

00:20:04.269 --> 00:20:05.871
being in detention is a choice.

00:20:05.938 --> 00:20:08.273
There you have the agency, referring
to the fact that the administration

00:20:08.273 --> 00:20:11.043
has reportedly offering $2,600
in a free flight to people

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:13.712
who leave voluntarily, but also for people
who have been living here

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:15.280
for years or fear going home,

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.515
it might not feel like much of a choice.

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:18.183
And similarly, you had officials claiming

00:20:18.183 --> 00:20:20.652
that parents can choose
whether to be detained with their kids.

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:22.120
But many families have said
they've been given

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.989
no option
but to bring their kids with them.

00:20:23.989 --> 00:20:25.490
But also,
you know, with everything going on

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.759
and on the subject of immigration,
another big piece of news

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:29.561
that we didn't get to cover
was a federal judge

00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:32.064
saying last week that the government
may have kept thousands

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:33.332
of immigrants detained in Minnesota

00:20:33.332 --> 00:20:34.833
from accessing legal assistance.

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:36.068
And so with that, this judge

00:20:36.201 --> 00:20:38.470
ordered the Trump administration
to make sure that detainees

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:39.938
have adequate access to lawyers

00:20:39.938 --> 00:20:41.440
and that including by being allowed access

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.674
to a phone within one hour,

00:20:42.674 --> 00:20:43.976
their detention, and before they're

00:20:43.976 --> 00:20:45.277
being transferred out of the center,

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:47.479
as well as by requiring
that they be kept in the state

00:20:47.479 --> 00:20:49.448
for at least three days
before being transferred out.

00:20:49.448 --> 00:20:51.183
So they have a chance to get local legal

00:20:51.183 --> 00:20:52.417
representation or with a judge.

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:54.453
Writing in her order,
the government failed to plan

00:20:54.453 --> 00:20:55.654
for the constitutional rights

00:20:55.654 --> 00:20:56.888
of its civil detainees,

00:20:56.888 --> 00:20:58.924
the government suggests,
with minimal explanation

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:00.559
and even less evidence, that doing

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:01.994
so would result in chaos.

00:21:01.994 --> 00:21:03.996
And, of course, you know, in addition
to the judge slamming ice

00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:06.265
for violating the Constitution,
you've seen these judges

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:08.867
also widely criticizing
the agency for defying court orders.

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:10.569
But, of course, in the meantime,
words are words.

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:12.404
And what's happening on
the ground is actual action.

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:14.873
And actually on the note of action
and what's happening on the ground,

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.308
even though ice is ending

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:17.843
its surge of agents in Minnesota.

00:21:17.843 --> 00:21:19.878
I mean, we should talk about how they're
still dealing with the fallout.

00:21:19.878 --> 00:21:21.613
First of all, you add
borders are Tom Homan

00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:24.216
telling reporters yesterday
that a small number of security forces

00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:26.518
will still remain in Minnesota
to respond to protests

00:21:26.518 --> 00:21:29.288
and what he described as agitators,
but also how many didn't say

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:31.023
how big the remaining force will be or

00:21:31.023 --> 00:21:32.491
how long they'll stay, raising

00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:35.160
serious concerns that the operations
are actually winding down.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.461
And that's especially alarming given

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:37.929
some recent information we just learned,

00:21:37.996 --> 00:21:39.398
because it turns out
that immigration agents

00:21:39.398 --> 00:21:41.466
there may have shot someone in the street,
while the administration

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:43.101
then lied about what happened and wrote

00:21:43.101 --> 00:21:44.536
false accusations at the victim.

00:21:44.536 --> 00:21:46.772
And I'm not even talking about Alex party
or any good.

00:21:46.772 --> 00:21:49.174
I'm talking about this other officer
related shooting that happened last month

00:21:49.174 --> 00:21:51.810
with Julio Cesar
Sosa Salazar, who was shot in the leg

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.146
by an officer near the DOJ
bringing charges against him

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:56.815
and another guy accusing them of assault,
with the official narrative

00:21:56.815 --> 00:21:58.784
being that Ice agents
had tried to pull them over.

00:21:58.784 --> 00:22:00.118
But the two men drove off,

00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:01.553
crashed the car and fled on foot,

00:22:01.553 --> 00:22:03.722
and saying that
the men violently resisted arrest.

00:22:03.722 --> 00:22:05.090
When a third guy came out to help,

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.558
including by attacking the agents

00:22:06.558 --> 00:22:08.026
with a snow shovel and a broom handle.

00:22:08.026 --> 00:22:09.461
But very notably, this incident wasn't

00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:11.630
on video, and the cracks in this case
started to appear

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:12.631
as soon as it got to court.

00:22:12.631 --> 00:22:14.466
But with officials
changing their original account

00:22:14.466 --> 00:22:16.802
of what happened and their new testimony
still being different

00:22:16.802 --> 00:22:19.471
from testimony given by the two defendants
and three other witnesses.

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:21.406
And actually, last week,
the prosecutor is moving to get

00:22:21.406 --> 00:22:23.375
those charges
dropped with a filing from the U.S.

00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:25.844
Attorney's Office for the District
of Minnesota saying newly discovered

00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:28.547
evidence is materially inconsistent
with the allegations against

00:22:28.547 --> 00:22:31.083
them made in a criminal complaint
and a court hearing last month.

00:22:31.116 --> 00:22:33.051
Now, it's not clear
what the newly discovered evidence was,

00:22:33.051 --> 00:22:35.387
but the judge accepted the motion
to have the charges dropped.

00:22:35.387 --> 00:22:36.688
And while that matter is on its own,

00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:37.923
the bigger thing is that this makes it

00:22:37.923 --> 00:22:39.191
just the latest of dozens

00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:41.593
of felony cases against people
who are accused of assaulting

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:42.794
or impeding federal officers

00:22:42.794 --> 00:22:44.763
that have just crumbled,
and that includes several

00:22:44.763 --> 00:22:46.264
where agents fired their weapons.

00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:48.967
And I think it's important we talk about
every aspect of what we've just talked

00:22:48.967 --> 00:22:50.736
about over the last minutes,
because not only, you know,

00:22:50.802 --> 00:22:52.070
is it your tax money

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:54.473
that is making all of this possible,
just being burnt

00:22:54.473 --> 00:22:57.843
and wasted on unneeded horrors,
but also because it's important

00:22:57.843 --> 00:23:01.413
to go into the details
and see how different reality is

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.849
from what the administration
is saying that it's doing.

00:23:03.849 --> 00:23:05.717
But that, my friends,
you beautiful bastards, is

00:23:05.717 --> 00:23:07.652
where your Monday
Philip DeFranco show is going to end.

00:23:07.652 --> 00:23:08.854
But you got more to watch.

00:23:08.854 --> 00:23:10.389
This just a click away
because my new interview

00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:12.257
and podcast with Adam Freedland came out.

00:23:12.257 --> 00:23:14.326
It is the first episode of 2026

00:23:14.326 --> 00:23:15.827
for In Good Faith,
and I think you'll love it.

00:23:15.827 --> 00:23:17.929
I definitely want to check it out
and subscribe to the channel.

00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:19.831
I went kind of old school with a deeper,

00:23:19.831 --> 00:23:21.066
longer conversation with someone.

00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:22.601
I'm just very fascinated by.

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:24.536
But hey, no matter what you do,
let me just say I love your face.

00:23:24.536 --> 00:23:25.837
I hope you have a great rest of your day

00:23:25.837 --> 00:23:27.339
and I'll see you right back here tomorrow.

00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:29.174
I'm going to ask you a question
here in a second,

00:23:29.174 --> 00:23:30.409
and you can tell me to go

00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:31.610
fuck myself and cut it.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:32.711
I was going to preface that.

00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:34.012
You're thinking, that's a great one.

00:23:34.045 --> 00:23:35.213
How did you find that?

00:23:35.213 --> 00:23:36.481
What kind of research are you doing?

00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:37.682
You won't get used to.

00:23:37.682 --> 00:23:39.184
You'll never pay the pale. Go.

00:23:39.384 --> 00:23:41.720
They gave you
a really good piece of advice.

00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:44.189
I was horrible,
so one time I've been fired from a job.
