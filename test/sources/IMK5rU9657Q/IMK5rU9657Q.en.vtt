00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.866
you beautiful bastards.

00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:04.833
Welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show.
You daily dive into the news.

00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:07.800
It is Monday, February 9th.
I am outside right now.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.066
We're going to try and do this show.
Oh, hi.

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:13.066
we, the show

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:20.866
here we go.

00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.300
My wife
thought she could tell you guys secrets.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.233
Like I don't control the edit. Hey. Yes.
Welcome back to the Philip DeFranco show.

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:28.166
I've got a fantastic show for you today.
It is obviously, as you can tell by.

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.466
I guess this is a throne.
Today's show is coming to you

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.400
from the road,
specifically Cocoa Beach, Florida.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.200
that's because I'm a genius,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.466
and I booked a nonrefundable place
to stay for the Artemis two launch.

00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.566
You know, thing that famously,
it couldn't be postponed

00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:42.933
because of the slightest change in weather
or a test not going 100% perfect.

00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:43.933
Space travel, of course.

00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.200
Famously known
for the lack of uncertainty.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.266
so I decided to still steal my,
my wife and kids away for a little break

00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:52.533
before everything gets really chaotic,
especially for her with, the campaign,

00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:55.800
know, that's a we have a lot we need to
talk about today, starting with this.

00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:59.900
Kash Patel is a shameless bootlicker
a liar and he has to absolutely know it

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.300
right?

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.366
that's essentially the big takeaway
from this New York Times

00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:05.833
bombshell report about what happened
just hours after Jonathan Ross shot Renee.

00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:06.766
Good in the face.

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.366
because reportedly, a senior prosecutor
by the name of Joseph Thompson

00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.233
sought a warrant
to search her vehicle for evidence

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:14.333
and what he expected would be a standard
civil rights investigation into the agents

00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.000
use of force.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.566
or with him
emailing colleagues at state authorities

00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:19.266
who specialize in police shootings
would team up with the FBI on the probe.

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:22.400
you got several sources segment later
that week as FBI agents are equipped

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.166
with a signed warrant, prepared a document

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.966
blood spatter and bullet holes in the car.

00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.433
They received orders to stop.

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:29.666
who did those orders come from,
you might ask? reportedly

00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:33.100
it was senior officials, including the FBI
director himself, Kash Patel.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.533
and you had sources saying
that several of them,

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:36.166
they worried that
a civil rights investigation,

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:39.366
by using a warrant obtained on that basis,
would contradict Trump's claim

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:42.433
that good violently, willfully
and viciously ran over Jonathan Ross,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.533
you know, in other words, that the facts
would just expose the regime's lies.

00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:48.266
so instead over the next few days,
top Trump DOJ officials,

00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:50.500
they reportedly presented
alternative approaches.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.400
such as, you know, seeking a warrant
predicated on a criminal investigation,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.666
not into
whether Ross's use of force was justified,

00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:58.200
but into whether he had been assaulted
by good. or another idea.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.966
They could just ditch the probe
into the shooting altogether.

00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:03.166
And instead investigate Goode's partner,
who was there the day that she got shot.

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:04.600
Now with that,
according to the times, Thompson

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.700
and several other prosecutors,
a balked at these ideas,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.700
just like any sane human would, viewing
them as legally dubious and incendiary.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.000
hell, even lawyers who thought
the shooting might have been lawful.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.100
They wanted the investigation
into the use of force.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.733
so Thompson and five others, they quit.

00:02:16.733 --> 00:02:20.566
At which point AG Pam Bondi told Fox News
that they were members of the Deep State

00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:23.366
who suddenly decided they didn't
want to support the men and women of Ice.

00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:26.000
then she actually took the extra step
of formally firing them,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.033
even though they had already resigned,
which deprive them of months of paid leave

00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:29.833
that they had accumulated.

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:32.933
then after that, the dam broke with more
and more lawyers ditching the office.

00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:35.233
And now even the chief counsel for Ice
and Minnesota leaving.

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:36.033
retentions in the office.

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:37.700
They're so high that staff
say that the U.S.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.433
attorney for Minnesota,

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:41.800
Daniel Rosen, a commercial litigator
with no prior experience in criminal law.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.800
has made unsettling comments

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.100
about how he wouldn't
ask anyone to do anything illegal,

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.200
which is an assurance
that would normally go without saying.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.133
but also, you know, other
Democratic states, they're watching

00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:52.066
what's happening in Minnesota and going,
yeah, we don't want any of that shit.

00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:54.700
and so now you're seeing them
batten down the hatches with Zoran Mamdani

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.033
leading the charge and reasserting
New York's status as a sanctuary city.

00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:01.033
Across this country, day after day,

00:03:01.566 --> 00:03:04.700
we bear witness to cruelty that staggers
the conscience.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.966
Ice is more than a rogue agency.

00:03:06.966 --> 00:03:09.433
It is a manifestation
of the abuse of power.

00:03:09.433 --> 00:03:12.300
will make it clear once again
that Ice will not be able

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.300
to enter New York City property
without a judicial warrant.

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:20.666
That means our schools, our shelters,
and our hospitals.

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:25.933
As ice fosters a culture of suspicion
and fear, let this city of strangers

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:29.533
set an example for
how to make the sorrows of others our own.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.333
Let us offer a new path,
one of defiance through compassion.

00:03:34.433 --> 00:03:37.133
then almost immediately,
with DHS mouthpiece Trisha McLaughlin

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:39.266
responding with mom,
Mamdani will make New Yorkers

00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:41.300
less safe
as a direct result of this policy.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.466
and she demanded that he, quote, agree
to release criminals in New York City's

00:03:44.466 --> 00:03:46.366
custody to Ice
before they are released back

00:03:46.366 --> 00:03:49.366
to the Big Apple streets
to victimize and prey on more Americans.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.633
will Trump himself
is bit his tongue on Mamdani so far.

00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:53.433
Last month,
he threatened to cut funding for all

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:55.600
sanctuary jurisdictions
unless they change their laws.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.566
By February 1st.

00:03:56.566 --> 00:03:58.900
the for whatever reason, maybe dementia,
maybe something else.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.900
That deadline came and went with no cuts.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.966
also very notably last week,
you had Politico reporting

00:04:02.966 --> 00:04:04.133
that the Department of Transportation

00:04:04.133 --> 00:04:06.366
had actually drafted a proposal
that would halt transit

00:04:06.366 --> 00:04:08.866
funding to any major city
offering free bus service.

00:04:08.866 --> 00:04:10.666
now, a big thing is that
would have to be approved by Congress.

00:04:10.666 --> 00:04:11.366
But it does come

00:04:11.366 --> 00:04:14.366
as an apparent dig at mom Danny signature
free bus proposal that you've had.

00:04:14.366 --> 00:04:16.533
New Yorkers just worried for months
about the prospect of Trump

00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:18.066
cutting off
other funds to the city. Right.

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:19.900
Because they do depend on federal cash
for a lot of things.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.266
Health care, homelessness,
education, transit hubs, the Second Avenue

00:04:23.266 --> 00:04:26.633
subway station project, and so in fact,
Trump already froze billions of dollars

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.566
in funding for the Hudson River
gateway project

00:04:28.566 --> 00:04:29.833
that would connect New York City

00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:32.000
with new Jersey suburbs
through a pair of train tunnels.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.966
and actually, it was reported last month
that he reached out

00:04:33.966 --> 00:04:37.033
to Chuck Schumer and said, hey,
I'll restore the funding on one condition.

00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:37.400
disagree.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.366
To rename Penn Station
and Dulles International Airport after me.

00:04:40.366 --> 00:04:43.133
you know, just very normal and not at all
pathetic uses of presidential power.

00:04:43.133 --> 00:04:45.700
then to that Schumer was reportedly like
one that's unhinged.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.300
And two,
I don't have the authority to do that.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.200
Even if I wanted to.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.366
in the meantime, both New York

00:04:49.366 --> 00:04:51.266
and New Jersey,
they sued the white House with a judge

00:04:51.266 --> 00:04:53.566
ordering Trump to unfreeze the funds
while the case proceeds.

00:04:53.566 --> 00:04:54.866
what that covers Minnesota in New York.

00:04:54.866 --> 00:04:57.233
We then got a jump over to Texas,
where, in the words of Chris

00:04:57.233 --> 00:05:00.333
Murphy, Trump's baby
president, it's still a house of horrors.

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:04.433
with more than 750 families, nearly half
including children, as well as some 370

00:05:04.433 --> 00:05:07.533
single adult women, currently
hold up inside of the infamous Dilley

00:05:07.533 --> 00:05:08.500
detention facility.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.166
now we can actually hear

00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:10.866
from several of those children themselves,

00:05:10.866 --> 00:05:12.633
because ProPublica obtained their letters

00:05:12.633 --> 00:05:14.533
and drawings,
and they're just heartbreaking,

00:05:14.533 --> 00:05:18.133
with 112 year old boy writing,
they told me I could only be here 21 days,

00:05:18.133 --> 00:05:20.433
but I have already spent more than 60 days
waking up,

00:05:20.433 --> 00:05:22.733
eating the same repetitive meals,
going outside.

00:05:22.733 --> 00:05:25.833
And the majority of guards never pay
attention to people eating dinner.

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:27.433
Always the same as the day before.

00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:29.733
Seeing people cry
every day for the same reasons.

00:05:29.733 --> 00:05:32.866
Trying to sleep in that horrible,
uncomfortable bed, going to the doctor,

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:35.600
and that the only thing they tell you
is to drink more water.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.766
And the worst thing is that it seems like
the water is what makes people sick.

00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:41.933
We're going to wait for the bad answers
from the judges, hearing

00:05:41.933 --> 00:05:45.033
the bad news from people who no longer
have hope, having to share a room

00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:48.866
with minimum three families and all that
so they can send us back to our countries.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.600
then also had a nine year
old girl writing.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.066
I always traveled with my tourist visa,
but Ice used me to catch my mom.

00:05:54.066 --> 00:05:56.033
And now I am in jail and I am sad.

00:05:56.033 --> 00:05:57.866
And I have fainted two times here inside.

00:05:57.866 --> 00:06:00.233
I arrived every night I cried
and now I don't sleep well.

00:06:00.233 --> 00:06:03.566
I felt that being here was my fault
and I only wanted to be on vacation

00:06:03.566 --> 00:06:04.500
like a normal family. right.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.433
Then you had this 14 year old girl
named Ariana

00:06:06.433 --> 00:06:08.300
reading her own letter
aloud in a recording.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.233
Since I got to the center, all you will
feel is sadness and mostly depression.

00:06:14.466 --> 00:06:18.166
I remind myself
that once I go back to Honduras,

00:06:18.166 --> 00:06:21.200
a lot of dangerous
things could happen to my mom and I.

00:06:22.133 --> 00:06:26.133
My younger siblings haven't been able
to see their mom in more than a month.

00:06:26.133 --> 00:06:30.333
I haven't been getting any school time
either, or the other kids in here.

00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:32.766
All kids are being damaged mentally.

00:06:32.766 --> 00:06:36.433
They witness how their parents
and other people are being treated.

00:06:36.433 --> 00:06:36.966
but also with us.

00:06:36.966 --> 00:06:37.300
You know what?

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.366
Like,
one of the craziest things about it is,

00:06:39.366 --> 00:06:40.933
while the Trump administration
is deporting these little kids

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:43.566
to purge the country of foreigners,
it's allegedly covering up

00:06:43.566 --> 00:06:46.833
this mysterious phone call involving
Donald Trump and foreign intelligence.

00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:49.033
you may remember that last week,
the Wall Street Journal revealed

00:06:49.033 --> 00:06:50.233
that a whistleblower had accused

00:06:50.233 --> 00:06:53.500
intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard
of burying a highly classified report

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.900
that she was legally required
to disclose to Congress.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:56.566
that was back in May.

00:06:56.566 --> 00:06:58.666
And now the whistleblower's attorney
told the Guardian

00:06:58.666 --> 00:07:00.600
what the report was about,
saying that last spring,

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.433
the NSA flagged an unusual phone call.

00:07:02.433 --> 00:07:05.266
And at first, the attorney told the outlet
that it was between someone associated

00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:07.100
with foreign intelligence
and someone close to Trump.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.433
you're the attorney reportedly confirming
that account multiple times.

00:07:09.433 --> 00:07:13.033
But then after the article was published,
he went, hold on, I misspoke, saying

00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:15.200
that actually the call was between
two members of foreign intelligence

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.600
and merely involved someone close
to Trump's White House. right.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.500
And then you had another source

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.600
adding that the person close to Trump
is not understood to be an administration

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.266
official or a special government employee.

00:07:23.266 --> 00:07:25.233
But whatever the case is, that's really
all we know.

00:07:25.233 --> 00:07:26.766
So it's still very mysterious.

00:07:26.766 --> 00:07:28.500
either way,
the attorney says that the call is brought

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.333
to Gabbard's attention.

00:07:29.333 --> 00:07:32.066
And rather than allowing officials
to distribute the information further,

00:07:32.066 --> 00:07:35.566
she took a paper copy of it directly
to Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles.

00:07:35.566 --> 00:07:39.166
within the next day, Gabbard allegedly
telling the NSA not to publish the report.

00:07:39.166 --> 00:07:42.466
Instead, she instructed NSA officials
to transmit the highly classified details

00:07:42.466 --> 00:07:43.666
directly to her office.

00:07:43.666 --> 00:07:46.333
so for the past eight months,
this report's been just kept secret,

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:48.033
even from congressional intelligence
committees,

00:07:48.033 --> 00:07:50.800
which are legally required to be notified
of whistleblower complaints.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.166
then after this whole story broke
those committees, lawmakers

00:07:53.166 --> 00:07:56.133
got Ahold of a heavily redacted
version of it, so far what you've had is,

00:07:56.133 --> 00:07:56.700
splitting apart

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.333
across party lines on whether
the whistleblower complaint is credible

00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:01.166
and whether Gabbard's conduct
broke the law.

00:08:01.166 --> 00:08:03.400
Tom cotton in the Senate
and Rick Crawford in the House

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.266
coming to her defense and Democrats
calling for more transparency.

00:08:06.266 --> 00:08:09.166
with all of the lies and the secrecy
from this white House about everything.

00:08:09.166 --> 00:08:09.866
Renee. Good.

00:08:09.866 --> 00:08:12.566
Tulsi Gabbard,
Jeffrey Epstein, we'll also get to that.

00:08:12.566 --> 00:08:13.733
Trump wants you to believe that

00:08:13.733 --> 00:08:16.833
the real slap in the face to this country,
it was actually during last night's

00:08:16.833 --> 00:08:17.466
football game.

00:08:17.466 --> 00:08:19.900
you also have Trump weighing in on Bad
Bunny's halftime performance

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.266
at the Super Bowl last night,
calling it one of the worst ever.

00:08:22.266 --> 00:08:23.600
of course,
you had many people disagreeing.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.733
And it's just one way that we're seeing
sports and politics collide right now.

00:08:26.733 --> 00:08:27.533
the starting with Bad Bunny.

00:08:27.533 --> 00:08:30.400
We all know that the joy sparked backlash
among a lot of conservatives.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.533
And that's even though he wasn't
only the world's most played

00:08:32.533 --> 00:08:35.600
artist on Spotify in 2025,
but one of the most popular artists

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.900
just in the United States. right.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.300
We saw that the criticism stemmed,
at least in part, from the fact

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.100
that he's from Puerto Rico,
and he sings almost exclusively in Spanish

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.300
with some on the right blasting.

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.033
The pic is anti-American,
the of course, Puerto Rico is a U.S.

00:08:46.033 --> 00:08:46.533
territory.

00:08:46.533 --> 00:08:47.533
Bad Bunny is a U.S.

00:08:47.533 --> 00:08:49.266
citizen,
and there are tens of millions of people

00:08:49.266 --> 00:08:51.466
like him in this country
who are native Spanish speakers.

00:08:51.466 --> 00:08:53.300
but also another
part of the backlash has been Bad

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.200
Bunny is outspoken
criticism of Donald Trump

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.100
and his administration's
immigration policies.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.333
He previously avoided
touring in the United States over fears

00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:00.833
that his fans would be detained by Ice

00:09:00.833 --> 00:09:04.066
agents, instead staging a record
breaking residency in Puerto Rico.

00:09:04.066 --> 00:09:07.200
also recently blasted ice while accepting
a Grammy Award for album of the year.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.533
before I say

00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:12.433
thanks to God,

00:09:12.433 --> 00:09:15.433
I'm going to say eyes out.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.500
We're not savages. We're not animals.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.133
We're not aliens.

00:09:20.133 --> 00:09:22.533
We are humans, and we are Americans.

00:09:22.533 --> 00:09:26.233
The only thing that is more powerful
than hate is love.

00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:27.666
so with all that you had turning
Point USA,

00:09:27.666 --> 00:09:30.066
that conservative nonprofit
that was co-founded by Charlie Kirk,

00:09:30.066 --> 00:09:33.533
announcing an alternative event dubbed
the All American Halftime Show, saying

00:09:33.566 --> 00:09:35.466
he would celebrate faith, family
and freedom.

00:09:35.466 --> 00:09:37.200
And headlining
the show was kid Rock, right?

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.500
An outspoken Trump supporter
whose 2001 track Cool Daddy Cool features

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.566
a lyrics young ladies, young ladies
I like I'm underage.

00:09:43.566 --> 00:09:46.433
Some say that's statutory,
but I say it's mandatory.

00:09:46.433 --> 00:09:47.166
kid Rock and TPU.

00:09:47.166 --> 00:09:51.600
Asa really not doing themselves any favors
to combat the Epstein class allegations.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.366
despite that, you had tons of right
wingers saying they'd be tuning in,

00:09:54.366 --> 00:09:56.466
or at the very least, they wouldn't
be watching the official show.

00:09:56.466 --> 00:09:57.866
that included professional douchebag

00:09:57.866 --> 00:10:00.566
Jake Paul of all people
who actually lives in Puerto Rico

00:10:00.566 --> 00:10:03.866
and who you had slamming the halftime show
just a few hours before it happened.

00:10:03.933 --> 00:10:06.066
Jake urging his followers
to boycott the performance,

00:10:06.066 --> 00:10:08.300
saying, let's rally together
and show big corporations

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.600
they can't just do whatever they want
without consequences.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.533
also, he called Bad Bunny a, quote,
fake American citizen who publicly hates

00:10:14.533 --> 00:10:17.733
America, though there you had his brother
Logan responding to that post, writing,

00:10:17.733 --> 00:10:19.466
I love my brother,
but I don't agree with this.

00:10:19.466 --> 00:10:22.200
Puerto Ricans are Americans, and I'm happy
they were given the opportunity

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.400
to showcase the talent
that comes from the island. there, there.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.066
You also had Democratic lawmaker
Alexandria

00:10:26.066 --> 00:10:29.200
Ocasio-Cortez firing back,
writing a fake American citizen.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.500
Didn't you move to Puerto Rico
to avoid paying your taxes?

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.033
Well, kids across America go hungry.

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:35.800
Meanwhile, Benito
actually funds low income kids, has access

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.133
to arts and sports programs
while you defund them.

00:10:38.133 --> 00:10:40.000
Of course you're mad.
He makes you look small.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.833
the backlash actually got so big
that you had Paul

00:10:41.833 --> 00:10:44.000
trying to walk it
back, claiming that he wasn't calling

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.933
Bad Bunny a fake citizen
because he's Puerto Rican,

00:10:45.933 --> 00:10:49.533
but because of his, quote, values
and criticism of our great country.

00:10:49.533 --> 00:10:51.733
with him, then following that up saying,
guys, I love Bad Bunny.

00:10:51.733 --> 00:10:54.000
I don't know what happened on my Twitter
last night. What the fuck?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.733
which if you don't know him,
I think you should take is him

00:10:55.733 --> 00:10:57.433
kind of winking
and giving you the middle finger

00:10:57.433 --> 00:10:59.400
while he's writing that
instead of actually

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.766
saying he doesn't know what's happening.

00:11:00.766 --> 00:11:02.666
with that bullshit aside,
when it came to the actual show

00:11:02.666 --> 00:11:04.400
last night,
it was almost inevitably political.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.133
In some ways, though,

00:11:05.133 --> 00:11:08.366
I will say he also didn't directly
criticize Trump or the administration.

00:11:08.366 --> 00:11:08.900
right in the performance.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.133
It's been seen more as a celebration
of Puerto Rico in Latin America.

00:11:12.133 --> 00:11:12.200
Right.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.433
With fellow Puerto Rican artist
Ricky Martin, for example,

00:11:14.433 --> 00:11:18.133
covering one of Bad Bunny songs and Lady
Gaga delivering a salsa style version

00:11:18.133 --> 00:11:19.966
of one of her own.
also had Latino celebrity

00:11:19.966 --> 00:11:23.033
cameos like Cardi
B and Pedro Pascal appearing on stage.

00:11:23.033 --> 00:11:25.333
There was also an honest to God wedding
in the middle of the performance,

00:11:25.333 --> 00:11:28.233
with Bad Bunny serving as a witness
and signing their marriage certificate.

00:11:28.233 --> 00:11:30.933
I gotta mention this other viral moment,
which was when we saw his Grammy

00:11:30.933 --> 00:11:32.700
acceptance speech playing on a small TV

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.233
as a young boy watch,
and then was handed the award.

00:11:35.233 --> 00:11:38.200
Because you got a lot of people online
speculating that that boy was actually

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.366
Liam Ramos, that five year old
who was detained by Ice in Minneapolis.

00:11:41.366 --> 00:11:43.333
But I'm here to tell you
that is just not true.

00:11:43.333 --> 00:11:44.800
That was just a different child
altogether.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.466
really
the most explicit political messaging

00:11:46.466 --> 00:11:48.600
that we heard
came in the form of a call for unity.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.266
Bad Bunny shouted God Bless America!

00:11:50.266 --> 00:11:51.833
Before naming most countries in South,

00:11:51.833 --> 00:11:54.900
central, and North America
all the way from Argentina to Canada.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.500
then you had him holding a football
with the words together we are America.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.133
While the massive screen behind him read

00:11:59.133 --> 00:12:01.466
the only thing
more powerful than hate is love. Right.

00:12:01.466 --> 00:12:02.166
And then even though you had

00:12:02.166 --> 00:12:03.333
all these people saying they wouldn't

00:12:03.333 --> 00:12:05.366
be watching the show,
they apparently still had a lot

00:12:05.366 --> 00:12:07.633
to say about it afterwards,
including Donald Trump.

00:12:07.633 --> 00:12:09.533
with Trump
saying that it was absolutely terrible

00:12:09.533 --> 00:12:11.333
and one of the worst ever, also claiming

00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:13.100
it was an affront
to the greatness of America

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.366
and doesn't represent our standards
of success, creativity or excellence.

00:12:16.366 --> 00:12:18.866
And adding, nobody understands a word
this guy is saying.

00:12:18.866 --> 00:12:21.366
And the dancing is disgusting,
especially for young children

00:12:21.366 --> 00:12:23.966
that are watching throughout the USA
and all over the world.

00:12:23.966 --> 00:12:26.200
saying this show is just a slap
in the face to our country,

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.800
which is setting new standards and records
every single day.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.900
also the likes of far right
influencer and Trump Barnicle,

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.233
Laura Loomer taking in the direction
of just explicit racism, baselessly

00:12:34.233 --> 00:12:37.366
claimed that there were illegal aliens and
Latin hookers twerking at the Super Bowl

00:12:37.366 --> 00:12:41.066
and then adding not a single white person
or English translation at the Super Bowl.

00:12:41.066 --> 00:12:42.500
This isn't white enough for me.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.833
even watch a Super Bowl anymore

00:12:43.833 --> 00:12:45.733
because immigrants have literally ruined
everything.

00:12:45.733 --> 00:12:47.700
you also had right
wing grifter Benny Johnson piling

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.300
on, complaining

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.733
that no songs were in our language,
and claiming the NFL halftime show

00:12:51.733 --> 00:12:55.100
was a humiliation ritual to to base
American culture on a national stage.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.333
then also went on to talk about how
thankful he is that TP USA put on a show

00:12:58.333 --> 00:13:01.600
that was just a feelgood banger
after banger from American artists

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.166
who love this country,
and who football fans can relate with.

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:05.033
and actually with that

00:13:05.033 --> 00:13:07.800
along with right wingers
shitting on this widely praised bad money

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.833
performance, you also had them arguing
that they even clearly won

00:13:10.833 --> 00:13:12.366
the battle of the halftime shows.

00:13:12.366 --> 00:13:14.333
the truth there is
that there's very little evidence of that.

00:13:14.333 --> 00:13:16.100
we don't have the official viewing numbers
for Bad Bunny.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.766
Yeah, but if history is any indication,
it will be over 100 million.

00:13:18.766 --> 00:13:22.166
meanwhile, the All-American halftime show
reportedly pulled a little over 6 million

00:13:22.166 --> 00:13:23.200
live viewers at its peak.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.300
Although it's streamed
on some other platforms.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.400
also whether you had one popular right
wing account claiming X usage got so high

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.033
during the TP

00:13:29.033 --> 00:13:32.166
USA All-American Halftime Show,
the platform was down for brief moments.

00:13:32.166 --> 00:13:35.266
there as many pointed out
and as TP, USA itself announced

00:13:35.266 --> 00:13:38.366
that the real reason they had to cut off
the extreme was licensing restrictions.

00:13:38.366 --> 00:13:40.466
also with this,
there have been two other big topics.

00:13:40.466 --> 00:13:43.833
you had a lot of people accusing them of
using bots to inflate their view numbers.

00:13:43.833 --> 00:13:45.466
among those being vocal about that.

00:13:45.466 --> 00:13:47.900
You had Candace Owens,
you know, not the most surprising.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.866
She's been a vocal turning point critic
since Kirk's assassination.

00:13:50.866 --> 00:13:52.400
in addition to mining allegations,

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.400
she kind of came out against
both halftime shows.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.566
Writing on Twitter, I'm sorry,
but I hate both options.

00:13:56.566 --> 00:13:58.500
On the one hand,
we have a halftime show presented

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.333
without a word of English spoken,
then adding.

00:14:00.333 --> 00:14:01.766
On the other hand, we have an organization

00:14:01.766 --> 00:14:04.166
that scammed its viewers
by paying platform advertisers,

00:14:04.166 --> 00:14:06.366
followed by influencers
to pretend they broke records.

00:14:06.366 --> 00:14:08.200
The left versus right
grift is actually boring.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.133
Now, what exactly are we doing here
in America?

00:14:10.133 --> 00:14:12.866
wasn't entirely clear what she's on
about in terms of people being paid.

00:14:12.866 --> 00:14:14.900
That wasn't the only issue
that others found with the show.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.233
you had some noting that kid Rock appeared
to be lip syncing through

00:14:17.233 --> 00:14:18.400
at least some of his performance,

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.500
which some have argued
also appear to be pre-taped.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.966
and while in this performance,
you didn't have kid Rock

00:14:21.966 --> 00:14:24.433
singing his lyrics
about a preference for underage girls.

00:14:24.433 --> 00:14:26.933
It's still hard to argue that
all of his lyrics were family friendly.

00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:28.466
There was people noting that
one of his songs referenced

00:14:28.466 --> 00:14:31.700
topless dancers and geez, with the 40s
and the chicks with beepers.

00:14:31.733 --> 00:14:33.133
still
you had some influencers on that side

00:14:33.133 --> 00:14:35.533
claiming kid Rock brought millions closer
to Jesus.

00:14:35.533 --> 00:14:36.733
and actually, that same guy was over

00:14:36.733 --> 00:14:38.366
600,000 followers on Twitter,

00:14:38.366 --> 00:14:41.366
reshared Trump's post and added,
President Trump is always right.

00:14:41.366 --> 00:14:44.433
And also suggesting that Trump should be
made the new commissioner of the NFL.

00:14:44.433 --> 00:14:47.400
you know, ultimately, it's, it's
this type of total sycophantic loyalty

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.666
that the MAGA movement
seems to increasingly demand,

00:14:49.666 --> 00:14:51.200
even at the expense of reality.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.466
that's been on full display
at the Winter Olympics.

00:14:53.466 --> 00:14:55.766
I mean, just to start,
you had Vice President JD Vance

00:14:55.766 --> 00:14:58.833
getting booed during the opening ceremony,
which just that is a fact.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.733
It happened. Not everyone booed,
but it was audible and it was sustained.

00:15:01.733 --> 00:15:04.400
And it's been confirmed by reporters
on the scene, as well as feeds

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.233
from international broadcasters
like the BBC and CBC.

00:15:07.233 --> 00:15:09.666
There is the vice president,
J.D. Vance, and his wife.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.933
Those are not,

00:15:12.933 --> 00:15:15.666
Those are a lot of boos for him.

00:15:15.666 --> 00:15:18.666
Whistling during some applause.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.166
despite all that,
you still had mega accounts

00:15:20.166 --> 00:15:23.300
saying, hey, you know, whatever
you think you hear with your own ears.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.766
Vance wasn't actually boot.

00:15:24.766 --> 00:15:27.733
fact, some of them said the crowd roared
and the cheers were even louder

00:15:27.733 --> 00:15:28.566
than for Italy.

00:15:28.566 --> 00:15:31.000
then with that,
you had some sharing that NBC broadcast

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.633
where you can't really hear the booing,
which is actually led to the network

00:15:33.633 --> 00:15:35.833
having to fight off allegations
that it edited the audio.

00:15:35.833 --> 00:15:38.066
but then also despite that bit,
another big part of all

00:15:38.066 --> 00:15:41.433
this is the criticism that athletes
are facing from even Donald Trump himself

00:15:41.433 --> 00:15:44.533
for showing the slightest disagreement
with his administration's policies.

00:15:44.533 --> 00:15:47.666
so, for example, at a press conference
a few days ago, you had skiers on the U.S.

00:15:47.666 --> 00:15:50.800
team responding to questions about
what's going on back at home in the U.S.

00:15:50.833 --> 00:15:52.833
without you,
a two time Olympian and gold medalist,

00:15:52.833 --> 00:15:54.333
Chris Lillis, saying that, you know, he'd

00:15:54.333 --> 00:15:56.466
never want to represent
a different country, but adding.

00:15:56.466 --> 00:16:00.566
I feel heartbroken about what's happened
in the United States when, you know, I'm

00:16:00.633 --> 00:16:03.866
pretty sure you're referencing Ice and
some of the protests and things like that.

00:16:04.933 --> 00:16:07.266
I think that as a country,

00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:12.066
we need to focus on respecting everybody's
rights and, making sure that we're

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.400
treating our citizens
as well as anybody with love and respect.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.366
And, I hope that when people
look at athletes compete in the Olympics,

00:16:19.366 --> 00:16:22.566
they realize that that's the America
that we're trying to represent.

00:16:22.566 --> 00:16:24.800
then also had first time
Olympian Hunter Hess adding.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.700
It brings up mixed emotions
to represent the U.S. right now.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.700
I think, it's a little hard.

00:16:30.766 --> 00:16:34.400
There's obviously a lot going on
that I'm not the biggest fan of.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.900
And I think a lot of people aren't
Just because I'm wearing the flag

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.033
doesn't mean I represent everything
that's going on in the U.S..

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.100
So, yeah, I just kind of
want to do it for my friends

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.266
and my family and the people
that support me getting here.

00:16:45.266 --> 00:16:47.266
those comments,
they triggered a wave of outrage

00:16:47.266 --> 00:16:49.900
from those on the right who say that,
hey, athletes should just stay quiet.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:50.700
Or some arguing that

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.566
because they're not repeating
Trump propaganda

00:16:52.566 --> 00:16:54.933
or just saying why
they should be sent back home immediately

00:16:54.933 --> 00:16:57.100
and should be no longer
allowed to represent us.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.466
And some saying that they should have
their citizenship revoked.

00:16:59.466 --> 00:17:01.500
you saw this kind of reaction
from top to bottom.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.100
I mean, Trump specifically called out Hess

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.000
in a post on Truth
Social yesterday, writing.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.266
U.S. Olympic
skier Hunter has a real loser,

00:17:07.266 --> 00:17:10.100
says he doesn't represent his country
in the current Winter Olympics.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.433
saying if that's the case,
he shouldn't have tried out for the team

00:17:12.433 --> 00:17:13.500
and it's too bad he's on it.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.066
Very hard to root for someone like this.
Make America Great Again.

00:17:16.066 --> 00:17:18.200
you know, with all that, there are more
and more athletes speaking up.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:18.866
actually skier

00:17:18.866 --> 00:17:21.900
Gus Kenworthy who's competing for the UK
but grew up in the U.S he's been among

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.000
the most outspoken had him, for example,
the other day posting a photo on Instagram

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.733
showing the words Buck ice
peed into the snow with his caption

00:17:27.733 --> 00:17:30.466
calling on people to call their senator
and speak up against the agency.

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:33.200
also, unsurprisingly, you've had him
reporting receiving threats online.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.500
while many others have made
far more mild comments

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.300
and only in response
to questions from reporters,

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.766
they've still faced similar backlash.

00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:41.800
last week, for example, figure skater
Amber Glenn, who identifies as pansexual,

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.900
made comments encouraging Lgbtq+ people
to stay strong during

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.800
what she called
a difficult time for the community.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.000
then also shortly after she announced
she'd be stepping away from social media

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.333
after receiving a scary amount of hate
threats, very simply using her voice

00:17:53.333 --> 00:17:54.566
when asked about how I feel,

00:17:54.566 --> 00:17:56.766
two time snowboarding gold medalist
Chloe Kim, she's

00:17:56.766 --> 00:18:00.366
now the latest to come under fire for
just calling for more love and compassion.

00:18:00.366 --> 00:18:02.333
with one of her teammates
also saying that she was saddened

00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:03.433
about what's happening at home.

00:18:03.433 --> 00:18:05.533
and then there's more
we're going to dive into in just a minute.

00:18:05.533 --> 00:18:06.066
But first,

00:18:06.066 --> 00:18:07.233
let me thank a sponsor and say,

00:18:07.233 --> 00:18:09.833
you know, it is 2026
and we are already in February.

00:18:09.833 --> 00:18:10.866
like let that sink in.

00:18:10.866 --> 00:18:12.066
And if you've been waiting for the

00:18:12.066 --> 00:18:15.133
right time to launch your side
hustle or business site, that time is now.

00:18:15.133 --> 00:18:15.166
Right.

00:18:15.166 --> 00:18:18.333
Because I get it building a website, it
can feel way bigger than it actually is.

00:18:18.333 --> 00:18:20.700
But thanks to today's
sponsor, Squarespace, my book club,

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.333
it was a some day project
and then it went live in under an hour.

00:18:23.333 --> 00:18:25.533
help my team even use a Squarespace
for our daily newsletter.

00:18:25.533 --> 00:18:26.300
We're tens of thousands.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.633
Y'all get your PDFs fixed in your inbox
every weekday morning.

00:18:28.633 --> 00:18:30.366
new polls, giveaways, PDFs, show notes

00:18:30.366 --> 00:18:32.266
all run through Squarespace
like clockwork.

00:18:32.266 --> 00:18:35.166
A daily tip newsletter went out this
morning, and your project could be next.

00:18:35.166 --> 00:18:36.700
it really should be especially
because it couldn't

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.666
be easier to just start showing stuff,
selling content courses, physical

00:18:40.666 --> 00:18:42.666
or digital products,
whatever you're dreaming up, you can do.

00:18:42.666 --> 00:18:43.933
some of the
I know that's big for a lot of people

00:18:43.933 --> 00:18:46.633
want one time payment subscriptions
both done and done. there.

00:18:46.633 --> 00:18:47.433
Beautiful templates.

00:18:47.433 --> 00:18:48.933
It makes it look like you hired
a designer.

00:18:48.933 --> 00:18:51.700
And their fluid engine
editor lets you drag, drop, and customize.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.500
No coding, no stress, no excuses.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.300
hey, take that first step.

and just remember that when it's ready

00:18:59.833 --> 00:19:02.833
to go live, use code, fail to get 10% off
and let them know we sent you.

00:19:02.866 --> 00:19:04.833
then,
but then diving right back into the news.

00:19:04.833 --> 00:19:07.866
We need to talk about this PSA
that Epstein survivors released on Super

00:19:07.866 --> 00:19:11.233
Bowl Sunday, calling out Attorney
General Pam Bondi, handling of the files.

00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:13.133
because it starts with text
noting that even months

00:19:13.133 --> 00:19:15.166
after the Epstein Files
Transparency Act was passed,

00:19:15.166 --> 00:19:17.400
3 million files
still haven't been released to the public.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.700
and with redactions
and covering the faces of survivors.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.033
They say. After years of being kept apart,

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.566
we're standing together.

00:19:24.566 --> 00:19:26.833
Standing. Standing together.

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:29.066
Because this girl deserves the truth.

00:19:29.066 --> 00:19:30.700
Because she deserves the truth.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.800
Because we all deserve the truth.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.866
with a then ending with text
urging the viewers to demand the body

00:19:35.866 --> 00:19:37.333
just tell the truth. range of these women.

00:19:37.333 --> 00:19:39.933
They made this ad with the help of World
Without Exploitation,

00:19:39.933 --> 00:19:42.133
which also has a petition
in support of the survivors.

00:19:42.133 --> 00:19:42.633
Right now.

00:19:42.633 --> 00:19:45.733
well, some reports suggest that it did air
in some markets, others say that it was

00:19:45.733 --> 00:19:48.066
primarily intended to be a digital
ad that capitalize

00:19:48.066 --> 00:19:49.200
on the attention of the Super Bowl.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.833
And with that, you had tons of politicians
sharing it,

00:19:50.833 --> 00:19:52.833
saying that it was the most important
ad of the day.

00:19:52.833 --> 00:19:55.433
and also say it comes at a crucial time
because starting this week,

00:19:55.433 --> 00:19:58.000
members of Congress
can review the obscene files unredacted.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.900
the files will be made available on
computers in a room at the DOJ building.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.266
And while lawmakers
cannot bring electronics into the room,

00:20:03.266 --> 00:20:05.000
they are allowed to take notes
on what they see.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.700
and so you've got Representatives
Thomas Massie and O'Connor going today

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.600
with Massie actually asking Americans
which files he should prioritize.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.366
and among the top responses,
you have one file

00:20:12.366 --> 00:20:14.266
where a redacted email address
tells obscene.

00:20:14.266 --> 00:20:17.266
Thank you for a fun night.
Your littlest girl was a little naughty.

00:20:17.266 --> 00:20:20.366
as well as another email from a redacted
address mentioning a torture video

00:20:20.366 --> 00:20:24.166
and an FBI intake sheet referencing
a child's body being buried in New Mexico.

00:20:24.166 --> 00:20:24.366
and, you know,

00:20:24.366 --> 00:20:25.600
we're gonna have to wait
to see what lawmakers

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.033
end up saying after viewing the files

00:20:27.033 --> 00:20:29.500
if it leads to another push
for everything else to be released,

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.666
and if any major questions
actually get answered.

00:20:31.666 --> 00:20:34.066
Because today, Glenn Maxwell
was supposed to answer

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:36.033
some of those big questions,
but gave us nothing.

00:20:36.033 --> 00:20:38.633
Regina virtual deposition with the House
Oversight Committee and ended up

00:20:38.633 --> 00:20:41.800
pleading the fifth on every single ask,
though technically, I guess it

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.266
it is still possible that she might answer
questions in the future, though.

00:20:44.266 --> 00:20:47.000
She has one
major condition, with her lawyer saying.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.366
missus Maxwell is prepared to speak fully
and honestly if granted clemency

00:20:50.366 --> 00:20:51.200
by President Trump.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.133
and even saying that Maxwell

00:20:52.133 --> 00:20:53.233
would provide testimony claiming

00:20:53.233 --> 00:20:56.566
that both Trump and former president Bill
Clinton are innocent of any wrongdoing.

00:20:56.566 --> 00:20:59.266
but the demand it's outraged
a lot of lawmakers who said that

00:20:59.266 --> 00:21:03.266
she must immediately be sent back to the
maximum security prison where she belongs.

00:21:03.266 --> 00:21:05.133
also had others
pivoting blame to Donald Trump

00:21:05.133 --> 00:21:07.533
for not concretely ruling out a pardon
for Maxwell.

00:21:07.533 --> 00:21:11.033
Ghislaine Maxwell should have no hope
of ever getting out of prison.

00:21:11.033 --> 00:21:15.400
she is campaigning over and over again
to get that pardoned from President Trump.

00:21:15.866 --> 00:21:18.066
And this president has not ruled it out.

00:21:18.066 --> 00:21:21.833
And so that is why she's continuing
to not cooperate with our investigation.

00:21:21.833 --> 00:21:25.533
This was an effort to essentially try
to secure her pardon

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.266
by keeping her mouth shut.

00:21:27.266 --> 00:21:29.166
President Trump could end that today.

00:21:30.233 --> 00:21:30.566
He could

00:21:30.566 --> 00:21:34.233
rule out clemency for Glenn Maxwell,
the monster.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:39.100
He could rule out a pardon for Ghislaine
Maxwell, the monster.

00:21:39.766 --> 00:21:43.866
The question for all of us
today is why hasn't he done that?

00:21:44.166 --> 00:21:46.933
And why won't he do that
but also I'll add like

00:21:46.933 --> 00:21:48.266
if you think the Epstein files
are creating

00:21:48.266 --> 00:21:51.466
any sort of political mess over here,
you should see what's happening in the UK.

00:21:51.533 --> 00:21:53.433
we talked a little about this before
ambassador Peter

00:21:53.433 --> 00:21:55.100
Mandelson resigned from the Labor Party

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.233
and House of Lords
after portions of the files suggested

00:21:57.233 --> 00:21:59.233
that he gave Epstein
confidential information

00:21:59.233 --> 00:22:01.233
about the government
and economy while in office.

00:22:01.233 --> 00:22:03.100
among other things,
that's created a major headache

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.366
for Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:07.466
Starmer's chief of staff just resigned
for having a part in appointing Mandelson

00:22:07.466 --> 00:22:10.700
to an ambassadorship, saying decision
to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.766
He has damaged our party,
our country and trust in politics itself.

00:22:13.766 --> 00:22:16.000
Saying I advise the Prime Minister
to make that appointment

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.133
and I take full responsibility
for that advice.

00:22:18.133 --> 00:22:20.833
but also there's a ton of pressure
for Keir Starmer himself to resign.

00:22:20.833 --> 00:22:23.266
And it's unclear if his chief of staff's
move is going to help him at all.

00:22:23.266 --> 00:22:24.766
no, that's Ed Starmer has tried to address

00:22:24.766 --> 00:22:27.300
the controversy himself,
apologizing to victims, saying.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.366
I am sorry.
Sorry for what was done to you.

00:22:29.366 --> 00:22:31.333
Sorry that so many people with power
failed you.

00:22:31.333 --> 00:22:35.133
Sorry for having believed Mendelssohn's
lies and appointed But still you people,

00:22:35.133 --> 00:22:37.200
including people in his own party
that want him out.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:37.900
also in the UK,

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.900
former Prince Andrew's embroiled
in even more scandals in the files.

00:22:40.966 --> 00:22:44.100
Because police are investigating claims
that he also gave confidential information

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:44.633
to Epstein.

00:22:44.633 --> 00:22:47.333
which I do have to say, as an American,
it is amazing to watch a country

00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:48.333
take these allegations

00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:50.033
seriously because,
you know, our president, he's

00:22:50.033 --> 00:22:52.466
implicated in incredibly
disturbing parts of the files

00:22:52.466 --> 00:22:56.033
and the odds of him resigning or face
any sort of crumb of consequence.

00:22:56.033 --> 00:22:57.966
They're they're slim to zero
at this point. right.

00:22:57.966 --> 00:23:01.166
But then finally from that today
we need to talk about how it's been

00:23:01.166 --> 00:23:04.666
nine days since Nancy Guthrie
went missing, and time's just running out.

00:23:04.733 --> 00:23:07.366
because as we talked about last week,
the 84 year old mother of today

00:23:07.366 --> 00:23:08.300
show anchor Savannah

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.733
Guthrie first went missing from her home
near Tucson, Arizona, on February 1st.

00:23:11.733 --> 00:23:14.133
And law enforcement officials,
they believe that she was taken by force.

00:23:14.133 --> 00:23:17.566
important personal belongings like her car
keys, phone and wallet were left behind.

00:23:17.566 --> 00:23:19.466
There was a trail of her blood
found on the porch,

00:23:19.466 --> 00:23:22.066
and it's unlikely that she wandered away
because her mind is sharp.

00:23:22.066 --> 00:23:23.400
But she has limited mobility.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.133
all the while,
you've had local authorities warning

00:23:25.133 --> 00:23:27.266
that time is of the essence here
because Nancy needs

00:23:27.266 --> 00:23:29.433
to take daily medication
or she can die without

00:23:29.433 --> 00:23:31.600
And while as of recording this,
law enforcement officials have said

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.566
they still haven't identified any suspects
or persons of interest in the case,

00:23:34.566 --> 00:23:37.866
over the past week, multiple ransom notes
have been sent to various media outlets.

00:23:37.866 --> 00:23:41.000
with a local CNN affiliate, Kgou,
and news reporting that it had received

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.200
a ransom note
demanding $6 million in Bitcoin

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.766
and threatening Nancy's life
unless the amount was paid out by today.

00:23:45.766 --> 00:23:47.933
notably with that
that outlet has since deleted videos

00:23:47.933 --> 00:23:51.000
on social media that mentioned the demand
and remove the 6 million figure

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:51.966
from its online article.

00:23:51.966 --> 00:23:54.166
with all this, on Wednesday,
you had Savannah Guthrie posting

00:23:54.166 --> 00:23:55.933
an emotional video alongside her siblings,

00:23:55.933 --> 00:23:57.966
where she acknowledged
the reports of ransom notes

00:23:57.966 --> 00:24:00.166
and said that her family was ready
to talk to the Kidnapers

00:24:00.166 --> 00:24:02.400
as long as they could prove
that her mom was still alive.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.866
but it's a key thing here.

00:24:03.866 --> 00:24:04.766
Law enforcement officials

00:24:04.766 --> 00:24:07.933
have not publicly verified
the authenticity of any of these letters.

00:24:07.966 --> 00:24:09.666
fact, even had the FBI saying last week

00:24:09.666 --> 00:24:11.500
that they had determined
that one of the ransom notes

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.500
was sent by an imposter
who's now been arrested

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.300
for sending a fake message in an attempt
to profit from the kidnaping.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.000
but also over the weekend,
you had Savannah

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.100
and her siblings posting another video
addressing the possible kidnapers

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.200
and seemingly referencing
a specific ransom note.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.033
We received your
message and we understand.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.066
We beg you now

00:24:30.066 --> 00:24:33.200
to return our mother to us
so that we can celebrate with her.

00:24:34.233 --> 00:24:37.233
This is the only way we will have peace.

00:24:37.766 --> 00:24:41.366
This is very valuable to us,
and we will pay.

00:24:41.833 --> 00:24:42.733
while Guthrie didn't specify

00:24:42.733 --> 00:24:45.766
which message she was referring to,
the FBI has confirmed that she was talking

00:24:45.766 --> 00:24:49.166
about a message sent to the CBS
affiliate called on Friday.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.833
there you've called, saying that
they won't reveal the contents

00:24:51.833 --> 00:24:54.766
of that message out of respect
for both the family and the investigation.

00:24:54.766 --> 00:24:57.000
And so we really don't have any idea
what demands were made, though

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.100
you did have an anchor for the station
telling CNN that the message included

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.066
sensitive information and no deadline,
and adding that the sender seemed

00:25:03.066 --> 00:25:05.066
to make an effort to include details
that would prove

00:25:05.066 --> 00:25:08.266
that they were the same person who sent
another ransom note earlier in the week.

00:25:08.266 --> 00:25:09.633
for now,
we're just going to have to continue

00:25:09.633 --> 00:25:11.533
watching this situation
closely for more answers.

00:25:11.533 --> 00:25:13.400
In the meantime, of course, again,
our hearts

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.233
go out to Nancy Guthrie's family,
her friends and loved ones.

00:25:16.233 --> 00:25:18.933
that, my friends, is the end
of your Monday Philip DeFranco show.

00:25:18.933 --> 00:25:19.833
Thank you again for watching.

00:25:19.833 --> 00:25:22.566
Thank you for being a part
of another daily dive into the news.

00:25:22.566 --> 00:25:23.966
And I should see you right back here

00:25:23.966 --> 00:25:27.200
tomorrow, because I'm about to scoop
all of this stuff into a bag

00:25:27.233 --> 00:25:29.700
and just bolt to the airport.
I love your faces.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.266
And I'll see you right back here tomorrow.
