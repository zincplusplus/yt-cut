00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:00.967
The Epstein files, according

00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:04.137
to UN experts, suggest the existence
of a global criminal enterprise

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:07.474
that carried out acts meeting the legal
threshold of crimes against humanity.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.410
Despite the Trump administration's claims
that there's nothing to see here.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.480
These experts, they say that the files do,
in fact contain credible evidence

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.981
of the systematic and large scale

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:18.018
sexual abuse, trafficking and exploitation
of women and girls.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:19.486
And in addition
to saying there is suggestive

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:21.287
of the existence
of a global criminal enterprise.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:26.059
They added so grave is the scale, nature,
systematic character and transnational

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:29.262
reach of these atrocities against women
and girls that a number of them

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:32.332
may reasonably meet the legal threshold
of crimes against humanity.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.300
And of course, it is very clear
to most of us

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.369
that Epstein was an inhumane monster.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.238
This is notable
because we're talking about something

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:41.107
with very specific criteria.
Under international criminal law.

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:44.544
The crimes against humanity are acts
including sexual slavery, rape and forced

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.312
prostitution, trafficking or murder

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:48.181
knowingly committed
as part of a widespread

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.450
or systematic attack
against any civilian population.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.053
And you have these experts suggesting
that this criteria may have been met,

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.055
because, of course,
the nature of the crimes committed,

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.557
as well as the scale of them,
but also because they were committed

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:01.394
against a backdrop of supremacist beliefs,
racism, corruption, extreme misogyny,

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.363
and the commodification and dehumanization

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:05.198
of women and girls
from different parts of the world.

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:07.000
One of the biggest points here
is that Epstein's crimes,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.736
and those of whoever else, may
have been involved, they weren't random.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:10.570
They may have been organized,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.371
and they have been part

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:12.906
of a sort of ideologically driven

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:16.109
attack on women and girls by people
who saw them as less than human right.

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:19.312
In her memoir, Virginia Giuffre wrote
that Epstein like to tell friends

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:22.082
that women were merely a life
support system for a vagina.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.084
We saw this kind of attitude again
and again

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.185
in the files that have been released,

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:25.552
and they show

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:27.787
that Epstein had been screening
young women from all over the world,

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:29.689
ranking them
based on their sexual attractiveness

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.525
and other attributes, and ultimately
bringing them into his service.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.260
It was reportedly common knowledge
that he often traveled

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.463
with an entourage of girls,
who he also described

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:39.699
in his correspondence as assistants
or students, a group that billionaire

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:42.602
Richard Branson referred to in one email
as Epstein's harem.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.671
So much of this
it happened long after law enforcement

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:47.774
first began investigating Epstein
for child sexual abuse back in 2005.

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:48.908
I mean, a lot is Mr.

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:50.977
Forgotten,
but just just as a reminder, way back

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:53.279
then, federal officials
eventually identified 36

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.381
potential victims,
some as young as 14 years old,

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:55.915
and his method

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:57.750
had apparently been
to recruit these girls to his home

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.719
and persuade them
to undress and massage him,

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.021
but he would then force them
to have sex and pay them cash.

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:05.325
But he also avoided any real punishment
by striking a deal and pleading guilty

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:06.226
to lesser state level

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:09.262
charges, including soliciting prostitution
from a minor, and with that, he ended up

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:11.297
only serving 13 months,
and he got special treatment,

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:13.833
including work release privileges
not given to other sex offenders.

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:16.402
And then, of course, in the years
that followed, as we well know now,

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:19.472
he maintained and acquired close ties
to prominent people in politics,

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:20.940
finance, academia and business.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.709
But he spoke to many of them
about massages,

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.911
and at least some seem to know for
damn sure what he meant.

00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:27.981
But in 2010, for example,
he sent an email to Boris and each other,

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.116
then science adviser to the Gates
Foundation, saying

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:33.419
that he was finishing up a massage
with Leeds, responding with happy ending,

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.156
I hope, and Epstein replying
I'm too impatient. Happy beginning.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:39.425
Another email chain between Epstein
and the Emirati businessman Sultan Ahmad

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:40.460
bin Sulayem.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.095
They not only discussed a torture video,

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:45.431
but then shared details of a personal
masseuse and later Catherine Rumer,

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:47.400
a former white House
counsel under President Obama.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.868
She seemingly acknowledges
she knew the difference

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:50.937
between a massage
and Epstein's kind of massage.

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:54.073
And then with all that, the emails
also show that Epstein organized massages

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:57.243
for friends and connected them with women
or girls as favors or gifts.

00:02:57.343 --> 00:03:01.281
In 2017, for example, Deepak Chopra
complained to Epstein about a crazy day

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:04.284
and Epstein replied, I'm in Florida
but would like to send two girls.

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:05.552
There are also dozens of messages

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:07.921
that Epstein sent a billionaire,
Leon Black, and those.

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:10.290
You can see that Epstein
repeatedly asked for large sums of money

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.624
and claimed to have helped black

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:14.060
make payments to a woman
who accused him of sexual assault.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.563
These later documents, further
showing that Epstein encouraged black

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:17.430
to hire an investigator

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.566
to track the woman's movements,
and that he was receiving

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:21.935
updates on other women
to whom black had made payments.

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:22.835
And then, with all that,

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:26.005
the files also show that Epstein often
sent cryptic messages to his contacts,

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:26.639
suggesting that

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.342
he has some kind of dirt on them,
or that they shared some kind of secrets.

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:31.711
And this was also the case with yet
another billionaire less Wexner,

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:34.581
who was actually reportedly the source
of hundreds of millions of dollars

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:37.016
of Epstein's wealth, much of which Epstein
allegedly stole from.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:37.984
So that led to a falling out.

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:40.620
But Epstein later sent a message
implying that he knew things

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.355
that Wexner wouldn't want getting out
and all of that.

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:44.991
It becomes even more notable
when you consider that Virginia Giuffre

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:47.594
once claimed that she had been traffic
to Wexner by Epstein.

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:50.463
Also, a newly released
FBI memo from 2019 listed Wexner

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:52.232
as one of Epstein's possible
coconspirators,

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.300
although it also said
that there was limited evidence

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.335
regarding his involvement.

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:56.769
But also as recently as last year,

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:57.937
the DOJ, including Wexner,

00:03:57.937 --> 00:04:00.640
on a list of prominent names of interest
in the Epstein investigation.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.076
And then with all that, Wexner
actually testified about his relationship

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.677
with Jeffrey Epstein
before the House Oversight

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:07.247
Committee today, and he denied wrongdoing
as he's done before.

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:09.682
And he blasted Epstein
as a world class con man.

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:11.951
But ultimately, what you have
people like these UN experts arguing

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.620
is that bringing,
you know, a few of the most high

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.989
profile figures in the files to testify
before Congress.

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.491
That's not going to cut it, instead
saying there should be independent,

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:21.127
thorough and impartial investigations
into the allegations

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:21.928
contained in the files,

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:24.564
as well as inquiries to determine
how such crimes

00:04:24.564 --> 00:04:26.432
could have taken place for so long,
and adding

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:30.203
any suggestion that it is time to move on
from the Epstein files is unacceptable.

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:33.006
It represents a failure of responsibility
towards victims.

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:35.642
And actually, on that note. Well,
it's easy to get sidetracked by the files.

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:36.976
It is very important to remember that

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:40.480
some of the most damning evidence we have
is from the survivors, Virginia Giuffre.

00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:42.815
She claimed in her memoir
that she was lent out

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:45.818
to scores of wealthy, powerful people,
and she said she was habitually

00:04:45.818 --> 00:04:49.555
used and humiliated and in some instances
choked, beaten and bloodied,

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:52.892
even describing traffic to a man described
as a well known prime minister who

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:56.629
she said abused her so badly that for days
it hurt to breathe and to swallow.

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:58.898
Just this weekend,
you had another survivor, Juliette Bryant,

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:02.101
telling CBS about how she had been offered
a modeling opportunity through Epstein.

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:02.935
But Body Organizer

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:05.938
traveled to the US from Australia,
only for her to have her passport taken

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:08.241
before being sexually assaulted
and then trafficked for years.

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:09.242
You know, when we ask ourselves

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:11.077
how this type of stuff
could have happened,

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:14.147
I mean, the man who we have president
today, who was first elected

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.782
even after audio came out showing that

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:18.318
he once claimed that he could get away
with grabbing women by the pussy

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.386
because he was famous,
and he was elected again

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:23.022
even after being found civilly liable
for sexual abuse.

00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:24.724
And with that, you've got people out there
like Nick Fuentes

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:27.493
who have these massive following saying
shit like this on a regular basis.

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:32.832
When you see guys saying stuff like 16,
15, that's a literal child.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.834
This is feminism.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.469
That's a feminist construct.

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:37.403
Age of consent.

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:39.138
Feminist construct.

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:41.174
Google it. It is literally a FEM.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:43.042
What does that even mean?
No one even knows.

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:44.077
No one even thinks about it.

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:48.181
Rape is something that is played up
because of the way

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:51.150
that women have politicized sexuality.

00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:54.554
Women want to have no consequences
for their actions.

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:57.423
So rape is always a convenient excuse.

00:05:57.423 --> 00:05:58.858
And then actually, you know,
with all this beyond

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.927
the Epstein files,
there are obviously other examples

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:02.995
of the rich and powerful
getting away with abuse.

00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:04.297
Possibly one of the latest examples

00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:07.467
is come from Crystal Hefner,
the widow of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner,

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:08.701
because she's alleged that her dead

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:11.771
husband's foundation may be in possession
of a decades old collection

00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:14.941
of sexually explicit images of young women
and possibly underage

00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:16.342
girls, that were taken without consent.

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:19.412
With her also claiming that she was fired
as the foundation's chief executive

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:21.180
after raising concerns
about the collection.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.850
So she's now filed complaints
with the California and Illinois Attorney

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.853
General's office in an attempt to prevent
any potential distribution

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:27.720
of those images.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.522
And specifically,
she said that the foundation

00:06:29.522 --> 00:06:31.958
is in possession
of 3000 personal scrapbooks

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.226
containing thousands of nude

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:36.763
images of women, and Hefner's diary,
which contains highly personal information

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:37.997
regarding his sexual exploits,

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:40.166
including names of women
he slept with, notes

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:41.901
describing the sex acts
that they performed,

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:45.238
and in some instances, even information
tracking women's menstrual cycles.

00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:47.206
Crystal, saying that she's concerned
about possible plans

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:50.343
to digitize the collection, and adding,
I am deeply worried about these images

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:53.613
getting out a single security failure
could devastate thousands of lives.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.847
This is a civil rights issue.

00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:58.217
Women's bodies are not property,
are not history, and are not collectibles.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:00.753
Now, with all that, as of recording,
we haven't heard from the Hefner

00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:02.889
Foundation, so we're gonna have to wait
to see how this plays out.

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:03.489
But, you know,

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:06.526
while you can decide for yourself
what you want to believe in the meantime

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:11.297
to transition, Stephen Colbert is telling
you very clearly do not believe CBS

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.166
because Colbert slammed CBS on air

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:16.836
for the second night in a row, literally
comparing their legal defense to dog shit.

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:19.038
And of course, all of this
stemming from CBS not letting him air

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:21.774
his interview with Texas Senate
candidate James Talarico on TV.

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:24.744
And as we dove into yesterday,
Talarico is running in the dem primaries,

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:27.780
and CBS claimed that they intervened
because of the FCC's equal time

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.648
rule, which states that

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:30.817
if a broadcast network
gives airtime to one candidate,

00:07:30.817 --> 00:07:32.351
they have to offer time
to their opponents.

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:34.387
But because talk shows
are historically exempt from this rule,

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:37.557
many saw this as corporate BS,
corporate censorship, and CBS pledging

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:40.726
blind loyalty to Trump by silencing
Colbert and a Democratic candidate.

00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:43.796
And huckleberries still do the interview,
but he uploaded to YouTube instead.

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:46.632
Now, with all this, you've got CBS
defending itself, saying in a statement

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:49.469
The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS
from broadcasting

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:52.605
the interview with Representative James
Talarico saying the show was provided

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:55.875
legal guidance that the broadcast
could trigger the FCC equal time role

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:57.610
for two other candidates,
including Representative

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.345
Jasmine Crockett, and presented options

00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:01.647
for how the equal time
for other candidates could be fulfilled,

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:04.083
and then claiming The Late Show
decided to present the interview

00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:06.586
through its YouTube channel
with on air promotion on the broadcast,

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:08.821
rather than potentially
providing the equal time option.

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:11.123
And this statement was at the center
of Colbert's show last night,

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:13.392
where he literally equated
this response to dogshit,

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:15.328
and then went on to say
that the network told me

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:18.231
unilaterally that I had to abide
by the equal time rules,

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:20.066
something that I had never been asked
to do

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:22.001
for an interview
in the 21 years of this job.

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:22.568
I'm not a lawyer,

00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:24.103
and I don't want to tell them
how to do their jobs,

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:25.271
but since they seem intent

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:28.474
on telling me how to do mine, fellas,
I am well aware that we can book

00:08:28.474 --> 00:08:29.175
other guests.

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.843
I didn't need to be presented
with that option.

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:33.312
I have had Jasmine Crockett
on my show twice.

00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:36.148
Jasmine Crockett is one of the people
that Talarico is facing in the primaries,

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:38.684
and her most recent appearance on Colbert
Show was nine months ago,

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:40.553
even though that was before
she launched her Senate video.

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:43.155
People saying that it shows that he's
clearly open to her being a guest,

00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:44.824
and he has the contacts
to make that happen.

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:46.726
If the equal time rule
was really applicable here.

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:48.794
But then all of that brings
us to an FCC commissioner

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:50.930
who released a statement
saying that this has nothing to do

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.366
with the real FCC rules,
and it was just censorship, saying

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:56.302
this is yet another troubling example
of corporate capitulation

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:58.437
in the face of this administration's
broader campaign

00:08:58.437 --> 00:09:01.474
to censor and control speech,
saying the FCC has no lawful authority

00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:03.376
to pressure broadcasters
for political purposes

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.578
or to create a climate that kills free
expression.

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:08.047
CBS is fully protected
under the First Amendment to determine

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:10.249
what interviews it airs,
which makes its decision

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:12.552
to yield to political pressure
all the more disappointing.

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:15.254
Well, this whole situation,
it is a bad sign for democracy,

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:17.890
as I was talking about yesterday,
and it turns out to be true,

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.293
it ended up being so good
for Tyler campaign.

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:23.329
But in addition to all the eyes on
that interview this morning, he announced

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:26.799
this campaign raised $2.5 million
since this Colbert interview was blocked.

00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:29.335
Well, so with that, I'll say, you know,
while that is a very impressive stat,

00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:30.870
Talarico is not publicly celebrating.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.405
Instead, he said on MSNBC.

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:36.709
It should be troubling to all of us,
regardless of our political affiliations

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:40.212
or our political beliefs, that
the most powerful people in the country,

00:09:40.546 --> 00:09:44.517
the most powerful politicians
and the most powerful corporate executives

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.588
are working together
to sell out the First Amendment,

00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:51.757
to sell out our freedom of speech

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:55.027
in order to protect their own power
and their own wealth.

00:09:55.061 --> 00:09:55.528
Of course,

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:57.663
teller ego
is just one part of the dem primary,

00:09:57.663 --> 00:10:00.132
and one of his opponents,
Jasmine Crockett, went on MSNBC

00:10:00.132 --> 00:10:02.802
to share her side of the story,
and she said that she got a call claiming

00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:04.604
that CBS was told
that they could move forward

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:06.939
with a Talarico interview
if they offered her equal time.

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:10.743
But I did not get a request
from The Colbert Show to go on.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:15.948
As you know, I've been on Colbert
multiple times, and frankly, and,

00:10:15.948 --> 00:10:17.650
you know,
if we would have gotten an offer,

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.686
that would have been great, but,
we're in the middle of early voting,

00:10:20.686 --> 00:10:24.390
so I'm kind of focused on being in Texas
at this moment.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:29.295
And, you know, I, I don't know
what to believe, that's for sure.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:30.930
With rockets
saying that you would have had no issue

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.065
with the interview,
it just aired on the traditional broadcast

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:36.435
and acknowledged this whole controversy
just gave Talarico a lift in the race.

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:40.139
I think it probably gave, my opponent
the ABC was looking for.

00:10:40.172 --> 00:10:43.175
So I think it's probably better
that he didn't get on,

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:46.479
and that they went straight to streaming
because,

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:51.751
we know that when we resist
and when we know that, it seems like,

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:55.454
they're trying to change the
rules and bend to the knee,

00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:57.723
or been the needs of this

00:10:57.723 --> 00:11:01.694
president
that it backfires in, historic fashion.

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:03.696
And it has to be like this,
this hostile environment

00:11:03.696 --> 00:11:05.898
that the Trump regime has created.
It did backfire.

00:11:05.898 --> 00:11:06.866
There were all those views.

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:09.669
There's all that money that's been raised
and Google searches are up for Talarico.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.138
And it's coming
as early voting in the state just started.

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:14.640
But the timing of this boost is major,
and it's going to be very interesting

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.476
to see what kind of impact it has
as far as the actual voting began,

00:11:17.476 --> 00:11:18.210
if you are someone

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.180
that's celebrating this backfiring,
it should be a small celebration

00:11:21.213 --> 00:11:22.181
because as we talked about yesterday,

00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:24.617
this is not solve
the bigger underlying problems.

00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:26.419
This is a dangerous and scary environment.

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:28.921
This is supposed to have a chilling effect
on most candidates.

00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:31.290
If they get this crack down
or they don't get the opportunities,

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.726
they're very likely not going to get
the Streisand effect that we saw here.

00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:35.394
We get to see and celebrate the outliers.

00:11:35.394 --> 00:11:37.329
But most interviews like get killed,
they stay killed.

00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:39.031
Most corporate censorship, it works.

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:41.100
You know, CBS has behavior
and their defense,

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.600
which I think is

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.670
insulting to your intelligence, claiming
that they were just providing options.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.707
It shows what happens when networks
prioritize regulatory relationships

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:48.507
over journalism.

00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:51.444
And I think Wilbur is correct when
he compared their statement to dog shit.

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:53.446
And then there's more
we got to dive into in just a minute.

00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:53.846
But first,

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:56.248
let me thank a sponsor and say,
you know, matching outfits used to be all

00:11:56.248 --> 00:11:58.184
like something reserved for cheesy holiday
photos.

00:11:58.184 --> 00:11:59.251
And yet, here we are,

00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:02.221
because today's sponsor, Meundies
somehow made matching actually cool.

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:03.923
And yes, I mean, my wife and I are all in.

00:12:03.923 --> 00:12:05.057
But also, it's not just for couples.

00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:08.160
I'm talking family, best friends,
roommates, maybe chaos goblins.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.161
You live with same prints,

00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:13.332
different styles, boxer briefs, strong
briefs, bikinis, thongs, geeky styles.

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:14.567
Everyone matches their own way.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:17.002
It's coordinated without looking
like you lost a bet and the comfort.

00:12:17.002 --> 00:12:17.603
Ridiculous.

00:12:17.603 --> 00:12:18.971
Their ultra modal fabric.

00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:21.941
It's soft, breathable and dangerously
close to why we're anything else.

00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:24.076
These are the pairs you reach for first
and quietly hope they're clean.

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:24.777
Write me on undies.

00:12:24.777 --> 00:12:28.047
They constantly drop new prints too, so
matching never gets boring or repetitive.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.783
It's actually one of my favorite low
effort ways to feel weirdly put together.

00:12:30.783 --> 00:12:33.953
Let's her first pair promise makes it 45
days risk free, so try them.

00:12:33.953 --> 00:12:36.055
And if they're not love at first,
where they'll make it right.

00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:37.490
So you want to upgrade
your underwear drawer.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.925
You're looking to give something
that people will actually use me on.

00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:40.793

for up to 50% off me undies.

00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:55.174
But then diving right back into the news,
we've got to talk about how Zorn Mamdani

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:57.476
just fired the opening shot
and what looks like a full blown

00:12:57.476 --> 00:13:00.479
class war between Democratic Socialists
and New York's super rich.

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:02.281
But it is dramatic. It is intense.

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:03.182
And whatever the outcome,

00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:06.218
one thing certain someone is going to win
and someone is going to lose.

00:13:06.218 --> 00:13:07.920
But first, actually,
I understand how we got here.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.689
We got to go back a couple of weeks
to the moment that Mamdani dropped this.

00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:15.828
But I will be blunt, New York
City is facing a serious fiscal crisis.

00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:19.465
There is a massive fiscal deficit
in our city's budget

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:22.268
to the tune of at least $12 billion.

00:13:22.268 --> 00:13:25.538
This crisis has a name
and a chief architect.

00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:27.907
This is the Adams budget crisis.

00:13:27.907 --> 00:13:30.376
Now, for some context, I'm going to
explain real quick how this all works.

00:13:30.376 --> 00:13:32.444
As mayor, you're required
by law to balance the budget,

00:13:32.444 --> 00:13:34.313
which means making sure that revenue
and expenses

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:35.281
equal everything is, though

00:13:35.281 --> 00:13:37.416
you don't actually know
exactly how much your expenses

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:39.151
are going to end up totaling
until you get the bill.

00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:41.220
So you just kind of have to guess
how much they'll cost,

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.422
which introduces a certain
degree of honesty that New Yorkers

00:13:43.422 --> 00:13:45.457
have to count on from their mayor
about the future.

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:48.627
And Eric Adams,
he was not exactly famous for his honesty.

00:13:48.627 --> 00:13:49.562
And in fact, Mamdani,

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:52.331
he claims that Adams intentionally,
dramatically, and systematically

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:54.366
under budgeted city services or,
in other words,

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:57.369
their projected actual cost was far higher
than the numbers that he used.

00:13:57.403 --> 00:13:59.805
So that means that Adams could technically
meet the legal requirement

00:13:59.805 --> 00:14:01.307
to balance the budget,
and it would only turn out

00:14:01.307 --> 00:14:03.909
to be unbalanced later
on, by which time it would

00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:06.045
then be the next administration's
mess to clean up.

00:14:06.045 --> 00:14:07.713
And here we are with one very big mess.

00:14:07.713 --> 00:14:09.982
For reference, the budget gaps
we are facing

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:13.185
today are higher than they were
at the height of the Great Recession.

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:16.155
But also, he says that Adams isn't
the only one you have to blame, right?

00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:19.291
Because Andrew Cuomo also dug this hole
during his decade as governor,

00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:22.695
alleging that Cuomo extracted city
resources to shore up state level finances

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:24.830
while withholding revenue from the city
so that as a.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:28.834
Result, New Yorkers
contribute 54.5% of state

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:32.404
revenue and receive only 40.5%. Back.

00:14:32.404 --> 00:14:36.575
In fiscal year
2022, New York City sent $68.8

00:14:36.575 --> 00:14:41.480
billion in revenue
to Albany and received 47.6 billion back.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.948
But regardless of who's to blame,
you have them.

00:14:42.948 --> 00:14:45.951
Danny, saying that he's whittled down
their $12 billion deficit substantially,

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:49.121
explaining that by finding savings
in the budget, updating revenue estimates

00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:52.324
and drawing down in your reserves,
he got it down to $7 billion.

00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:55.694
And then you had Governor Kathy Hochul
pitching in another $1.5 billion

00:14:55.694 --> 00:14:59.164
in aid from the state, putting the final
deficit at around $5.4 billion.

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:01.233
So the bomb, it's definitely way smaller
than the one

00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:03.469
he initially dropped,
but it's still going to make a big boom.

00:15:03.469 --> 00:15:04.737
And so now the way that Mamdani presents

00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:07.740
it is that there are two paths for either
Hochul in the state legislature in Albany

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.644
raise income taxes by 2% on New York's
33,000 wealthiest residents,

00:15:11.644 --> 00:15:14.280
make over $1 million
a year, raise corporate taxes as well,

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.515
and stop the drain on city
resources to the state.

00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:18.517
Or they refuse,
and he'll have no other choice

00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:19.718
but to raise taxes himself.

00:15:19.718 --> 00:15:23.022
Except it won't be income taxes
that go up, or rather, property taxes.

00:15:23.022 --> 00:15:24.290
And I'm Danny was director.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.825
He said this option, it wouldn't
just hit the richest of the rich.

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:29.929
This would effectively be a tax
on working and middle class New Yorkers

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:32.998
who have a median income of $122,000.

00:15:32.998 --> 00:15:36.335
So that's a 9.5% tax
hike on over 3 million single family

00:15:36.335 --> 00:15:39.672
homes, co-ops and condos, as well as over
100,000 commercial buildings.

00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:41.941
And you got the Citizens Budget Commission
estimating that that would amount

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:45.744
to some 700 more dollars a year in taxes
with a typical owner of a one, 2

00:15:45.744 --> 00:15:46.645
or 3 family home.

00:15:46.645 --> 00:15:48.747
And then actually, in addition to that,
the city would dip into its cash

00:15:48.747 --> 00:15:51.717
reserves and pull out nearly $1 billion
for the next fiscal year alone.

00:15:51.717 --> 00:15:52.651
So that's why you have them,
Danny, saying,

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:55.788
is that first path of the income tax path
that'll provide long term stability,

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:58.791
while the second path, the property
tax path, is a last resort

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:01.660
that he deeply hopes to avoid
because it would cause significant pain.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.829
But because the first bat
is completely out of his hands, though,

00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:06.665
the state has to approve it,
he's proposing a budget. In the meantime.

00:16:06.665 --> 00:16:10.369
That's based on the second path, a budget
that would spend $122 billion

00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:13.839
for fiscal year 2026
and $127 billion for 2027.

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:15.274
This preliminary budget increases

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:19.979
city expenses by over $14
billion, expenses that we have to fund.

00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:23.882
Because the Adams administration
sailed to a $14 billion,

00:16:24.283 --> 00:16:27.419
only $576 million

00:16:27.586 --> 00:16:30.589
is going to deliver
new programmatic spending.

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:31.056
With all this.

00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:32.925
This is where we kind of delve
into the world of opinion.

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:34.660
You may have noticed from the clips
that I've shown you, that

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.297
he seems like he's opting for a governing
style of complete and total transparency,

00:16:38.297 --> 00:16:40.299
or whether or not
you think he's actually being transparent.

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:43.202
He does present himself that way. Like,
hey, I'm not going to sugarcoat this.

00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:44.536
There are a lot of problems.

00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:47.373
These are the solutions or these are
the best and worst case scenarios.

00:16:47.373 --> 00:16:50.209
But still, you have one reporter asking,
you know, what he would say to supporters

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:53.012
who might feel betrayed,
saying he ran an uncompromising platform

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:54.847
of making the city
more affordable for working people.

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:57.816
Though in his defense, you at Mamdani
saying like, hey, I'm doing everything

00:16:57.816 --> 00:17:00.919
possible with the tools at my disposal
inside of the bounds of the law.

00:17:00.953 --> 00:17:02.521
And that includes
going on a pressure campaign

00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:04.256
against the state government to force it
down.

00:17:04.256 --> 00:17:06.692
The first pass so that he doesn't have to
take the second, which I don't know.

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:08.127
There's there's actually a tax
the rich rally

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:09.528
that's happening
next week in Albany, though

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:11.864
Mamdani has reportedly told allies
that he doesn't plan to attend.

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:13.532
And all the while,
like a big aspect of this

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:15.334
is that Kathy
Hochul is up for reelection this year.

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:17.169
So she's facing
a ton of political pressure

00:17:17.169 --> 00:17:19.171
from multiple directions
to make the right calculation.

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:20.139
But as far as the math there,

00:17:20.139 --> 00:17:23.242
Mamdani is already endorser,
and he's so far avoided antagonizing her.

00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:25.377
You see him frequently
thanking her for her cooperation.

00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:27.246
And then also at the same time, he's
going to have to negotiate

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:29.882
with the city council,
who's Democratic Speaker Julie Menin said.

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:33.085
At a time when New Yorkers are already
grappling with an affordability crisis,

00:17:33.085 --> 00:17:35.888
dipping into a rainy day reserves
and proposing significant property

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:38.257
tax increases should not be on the table
whatsoever.

00:17:38.257 --> 00:17:40.692
The council believes
that there are additional areas of savings

00:17:40.692 --> 00:17:42.728
and revenue that deserve careful scrutiny,
before

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:45.764
increasing the burden on small property
owners and neighborhood small businesses.

00:17:45.764 --> 00:17:48.000
And then also at the same time,
you have other critics arguing

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.536
that Mamdani is two
paths are actually just a false choice,

00:17:50.536 --> 00:17:53.272
saying that there is a third option
cut expenses from the budget.

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:55.074
And actually, in response to that,
you had Mamdani saying

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:57.076
that they've already come up
with an aggressive savings plan,

00:17:57.076 --> 00:18:00.045
but if they cut any further, it's
going to severely impact city services.

00:18:00.045 --> 00:18:00.412
But for now,

00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:02.281
we're gonna have to keep our eyes on this
and see how it plays out,

00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:04.516
because they have until June
30th to agree on a budget

00:18:04.516 --> 00:18:06.385
and actually with their, well,
not guaranteed, it's possible

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:09.388
that other options are going to surface
in that time where if like for example,

00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:12.691
if Wall Street gains push projected
revenues up even further than expected,

00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:15.360
but also, if nothing, Budges
and Mamdani goes with the second path,

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.130
many property owners could find themselves
squeezed at both ends

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.365
because not only would
they have to pay more in property taxes,

00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:22.000
they might also make less in revenue,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.036
thanks to the partial rent freeze
that Mamdani wants right now,

00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:25.771
that looks like it might be a reality soon
because you,

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.673
the Gotham is reporting
that Mamdani is about to appoint

00:18:27.673 --> 00:18:30.843
five new members to that nine member
Rent Guidelines board, including the board

00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:32.845
chair, and reappoint one
giving him a majority.

00:18:32.845 --> 00:18:34.980
And so when they hold their annual vote on
how much rent

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:35.747
stabilized apartment

00:18:35.747 --> 00:18:38.851
owners can legally raise their rents,
the answer may be a simple zero,

00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:40.319
which actually is something
that's happened

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:43.021
before three times, in fact,
under former mayor Bill de Blasio.

00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:45.190
But, you know,
it is also still a hotly debated topic,

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.726
with one side warning
that landlords need to raise rounds

00:18:47.726 --> 00:18:50.162
to keep up with rising calls
and the other side countering that.

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:52.931
The data shows that most affected
landlords are doing just fine,

00:18:52.931 --> 00:18:55.033
and the people who really need help
are the poor tenants.

00:18:55.033 --> 00:18:55.400
And actually,

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.203
something you saw with this is that Eric
Adams tried to just short circuit

00:18:58.203 --> 00:19:00.372
that debate
by stacking the board with his own picks

00:19:00.372 --> 00:19:02.341
right before leaving the office
to hamstring Mamdani.

00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:05.344
But unfortunately for Mamdani,
two of his appointees withdrew.

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:05.644
So, you know,

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:07.646
now we could see the four
consecutive rent freezes

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:08.213
that he promised

00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:11.383
for his first term, knocking out yet
another one of his core campaign pledges

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:14.386
because he already got Hochul on board
with the nearly $1.5 billion child care

00:19:14.386 --> 00:19:16.455
expansion
last month, though it's only two years,

00:19:16.455 --> 00:19:18.557
so he's going to have to figure out
how to make it permanent after that.

00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:21.693
And that then leaves a few big boxes
to check off three busses,

00:19:21.693 --> 00:19:24.596
city run grocery stores, and 200,000
new affordable homes.

00:19:24.596 --> 00:19:26.832
And so, you know, with lots
and lots of play here, of course.

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:29.902
Yes, I want to know everyone's opinion,
but if you live in New York,

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:32.738
I would really love to know your thoughts
on what we're seeing play out here.

00:19:32.738 --> 00:19:34.840
But then, next up in the news,
we got to talk about

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.509
how Trump is now moving
closer to a major war with Iran.

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:40.512
And you have sources telling Axios
that he could come in weeks, maybe days.

00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:44.016
You have Iran saying that good progress
was made in nuclear talks, though J.D.

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:47.052
Vance says that military options
are off the table, and an unnamed Trump

00:19:47.052 --> 00:19:50.155
adviser said there is a 90% chance
that we see kinetic action

00:19:50.155 --> 00:19:51.023
in the next few weeks.

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:51.356
And of course,

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:54.760
all of this is coming from involving
a man who campaigned as antiwar.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.161
I'm not going to start a war. I'm
going to stop.

00:19:56.161 --> 00:19:59.965
Was one of the reasons
I was the only president in generations

00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:01.400
who didn't start a war,

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.671
is that I was the only president
who rejected the catastrophic

00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:09.508
advice of many of Washington's
generals, bureaucrats,

00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:14.146
and the so-called diplomats
who only know how to get us into conflict.

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:16.181
But they don't know how to get us out.

00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:20.686
Take a look at the globalist, war
mongering donors backing our opponents.

00:20:21.086 --> 00:20:24.089
That's because they're candidates of war.

00:20:24.122 --> 00:20:26.558
I am the president who delivers peace.

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:28.760
And it's peace through strength.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.128
The war in Ukraine.

00:20:30.128 --> 00:20:34.233
I will stop the chaos in the Middle East
and I will prevent World War

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:35.400
three from happening.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.903
According to Axios, the military operation
that sources described

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:41.106
would likely be a massive weeks
long campaign that would look more like

00:20:41.106 --> 00:20:44.176
a full fledged war than last month's
pinpoint operation in Venezuela.

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:45.644
They also added
that the military operation

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:48.447
would likely be a joint campaign
between the U.S. and Israel.

00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:49.147
That would be, quote,

00:20:49.147 --> 00:20:53.318
much broader in scope and more existential
for the regime than the 12 day war.

00:20:53.318 --> 00:20:54.486
Last June, when the U.S.

00:20:54.486 --> 00:20:55.654
and Israel launched deadly strikes

00:20:55.654 --> 00:20:58.724
targeting Iran's nuclear facilities,
ballistic missile sites and personnel.

00:20:58.724 --> 00:21:01.693
And, you know, these latest developments,
they come after weeks of mounting tension

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:04.263
back in January, Trump came close
to launching strikes in Iran amid

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:06.965
the regime's brutal, deadly
crackdown and widespread protests.

00:21:06.965 --> 00:21:09.034
But we had was Trump
eventually backing down

00:21:09.034 --> 00:21:11.937
after Iranian authorities said
that they canceled hundreds of executions

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:14.773
with Israel and several Arab nations
asking them to hold off.

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:16.908
And so instead, you had Trump
taking a two pronged approach

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:18.744
engage in military talks
with Iran while building up

00:21:18.744 --> 00:21:21.747
a massive military presence in the region,
and repeatedly threatening

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:23.915
Iran with military action.
If negotiations failed.

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:26.918
Since last month, Trump's been amassing
what he has called a massive armada,

00:21:26.918 --> 00:21:28.220
which reportedly has grown to include

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:32.190
two aircraft carriers, a dozen warships,
hundreds of fighter jets and multiple air

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:35.260
defense systems, where the US has steadily
been increasing firepower in the region

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.662
even as nuclear talks have continued.

00:21:36.662 --> 00:21:39.865
And as far as the negotiations on February
6th, with the US and Iran holding

00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:42.167
indirect negotiations in Oman,
you'd both sides

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:44.970
leaving, saying things had gone well
and more talks would be scheduled soon.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.139
Even Trump himself said
that the conversations were very good,

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:48.273
though he also warned Iran

00:21:48.273 --> 00:21:50.942
that there would be steep consequences
if they failed to make a deal. Right.

00:21:50.942 --> 00:21:52.978
And then ahead of another
round of indirect talks

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:54.279
scheduled this week in Switzerland,

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:57.516
you had both sides ramping up military
posturing and rhetoric for a while.

00:21:57.516 --> 00:21:59.685
There was just one aircraft carrier
in the region.

00:21:59.685 --> 00:22:02.054
On Friday, you had Trump confirming
he was sending a second one.

00:22:02.054 --> 00:22:04.256
Then on Monday, one day
before the second round of talks

00:22:04.256 --> 00:22:05.057
was set to start,

00:22:05.057 --> 00:22:08.760
Iran held live military exercises in the
Strait of Hormuz, or with experts arguing

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:11.163
the move was a show of power
intended to warn the United States

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:14.066
that if they escalate to full blown war,
Iran's prepared to disrupt

00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:17.069
a crucial shipping lane for oil and gas,
which could up and energy markets.

00:22:17.069 --> 00:22:18.537
Global satellite images have also showed

00:22:18.537 --> 00:22:21.740
Iran's been preparing and fortifying
sensitive military sites in Israel,

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.375
and the United States
have struck in the past,

00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:27.045
and so that includes missile bases,
uranium enrichment sites and one complex

00:22:27.045 --> 00:22:28.714
where experts say
that Iran appears to be building

00:22:28.714 --> 00:22:30.949
what could be a high explosive
containment vessel,

00:22:30.949 --> 00:22:32.684
which is critical
to developing nuclear weapons.

00:22:32.684 --> 00:22:34.219
And then, even as the negotiations
got underway

00:22:34.219 --> 00:22:37.356
yesterday, direct military posturing
has continued from both sides.

00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:37.756
The U.S.

00:22:37.756 --> 00:22:39.758
reportedly sent another 50 fighter jets
to the Middle East,

00:22:39.758 --> 00:22:41.927
while Iran fired missiles
towards the Strait of Hormuz

00:22:41.927 --> 00:22:44.730
and the ayatollah publicly
threatened to sink American warships.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.565
But then also,
as far as the talks themselves,

00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:49.735
it seems like the US and Iran both left
with slightly different understandings

00:22:49.735 --> 00:22:50.669
of how things went down.

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:53.905
Right on one side, Iran's foreign minister
told state television that good progress

00:22:53.905 --> 00:22:56.341
has been made and the countries
now have a clear path ahead,

00:22:56.341 --> 00:22:58.677
and that ultimately
we were able to reach broad agreement

00:22:58.677 --> 00:23:01.747
on a set of guiding principles based
on which we will move forward and begin

00:23:01.747 --> 00:23:03.515
working on the text
of a potential agreement.

00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:05.250
But then at the same time,
you're the US presenting

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:08.987
a more toned down version of events,
with Vice President Vance telling Fox.

00:23:08.987 --> 00:23:10.322
In some ways it went well.

00:23:10.322 --> 00:23:11.690
They agreed to meet afterwards,

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.527
but in other ways it was very clear
that the president has set some red lines,

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:20.599
that the Iranians are not yet willing
to actually acknowledge and work through.

00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:22.200
So we're going to keep on working it.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.203
But of course, the president
reserves the ability to say

00:23:25.337 --> 00:23:28.373
when he thinks that diplomacy
has reached its natural end,

00:23:28.573 --> 00:23:29.775
we hope we don't get to that point.

00:23:29.775 --> 00:23:31.243
But if we do, that'll be the president's
call.

00:23:31.243 --> 00:23:31.977
Now, with that, you know,

00:23:31.977 --> 00:23:34.179
both experts and people close to Trump
have raised concerns

00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:35.981
that he's really not negotiating
in good faith,

00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:38.350
and he fully intends
to launch a major military operation.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.018
And looking into this,
there are a number of reasons

00:23:40.018 --> 00:23:42.821
to think that, first up, this is literally
something we've seen Trump do before.

00:23:42.821 --> 00:23:45.724
He says he wants diplomacy and then
he turns around and launches strikes.

00:23:45.724 --> 00:23:47.793
Or when Israel initially launched
major strikes against Iran

00:23:47.793 --> 00:23:49.327
this summer, Trump said he was committed

00:23:49.327 --> 00:23:52.230
to a diplomatic resolution
on the Iran nuclear issue. And then, boom!

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:55.200
Ten days later, he authorized strikes
on three Iranian facilities.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.935
But then beyond that,
there's reason to believe that Trump's

00:23:56.935 --> 00:23:58.003
using the negotiations

00:23:58.003 --> 00:23:59.471
as a smokescreen to stall for time

00:23:59.471 --> 00:24:01.807
so that the US can enhance
its capabilities in the region.

00:24:01.807 --> 00:24:03.642
But many have speculated
that one of the main reasons

00:24:03.642 --> 00:24:05.610
that Trump backed down
from his initial threats to strike

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:08.713
Iran last month was because the US just
didn't have the firepower in the region

00:24:08.713 --> 00:24:11.850
to launch a large scale attack while still
protecting American forces and allies.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.418
But now the situation
and more importantly,

00:24:13.418 --> 00:24:15.754
where things are
and their capabilities, it's different.

00:24:15.754 --> 00:24:17.722
And actually, given the military buildup
we've seen from Trump,

00:24:17.722 --> 00:24:19.691
as well as his repeated threats
against Iran, if, though

00:24:19.691 --> 00:24:21.760
the talks fail
you, places like Axios arguing

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.562
that it's going to be hard
for him to back down

00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:26.131
without some serious concessions
from Iran on its nuclear program,

00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:26.898
but then also with that,

00:24:26.898 --> 00:24:28.834
it seems almost impossible
that Trump would actually

00:24:28.834 --> 00:24:30.569
get the concessions
that he believes are big enough.

00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:33.572
And so if Axios is to be believed
that this full blown military operation

00:24:33.572 --> 00:24:36.074
could come very, very soon,
but with I'm quoting an unnamed Trump

00:24:36.074 --> 00:24:38.910
adviser who said the boss is getting fed
up, some people around him

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:42.414
warn him against going to war with Iran,
but I think there is 90% chance

00:24:42.414 --> 00:24:44.316
we see kinetic action
in the next few weeks.

00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:45.717
Well, that was also echoed by Senator

00:24:45.717 --> 00:24:47.552
Lindsey Graham,
who said that strikes could be weeks away.

00:24:47.552 --> 00:24:50.288
Some sources have speculated
it could be even sooner, but two Israeli

00:24:50.288 --> 00:24:52.190
officials told Axios
that the Israeli government

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.526
is preparing for a scenario of war
within a matter of days.

00:24:54.526 --> 00:24:57.195
And if and when this happens,
I agree with Axios,

00:24:57.195 --> 00:24:59.297
who said this could be
the most consequential U.S.

00:24:59.297 --> 00:25:02.000
military intervention in the Middle East
in at least a decade.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.569
But then from that, finally today,
I want to do two things.

00:25:04.569 --> 00:25:07.973
One is a congratulations, and the last
is to talk about one more big story.

00:25:07.973 --> 00:25:09.841
So first up, congratulations to Hashi,

00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:12.844
Peking's latest weekly winner,
who just scored 500,000 tickets

00:25:12.844 --> 00:25:15.580
and will be attending a Padres game
this coming season. For the rest of y'all.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.183
That's right,
Zeke is still giving away $500 in tickets,

00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:19.951
and you should definitely enter today
if you haven't already.

00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:22.220
Imagine me in the next winner
and snagging $500

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.955
or seeing your favorite artist
sporting event or play.

00:25:23.955 --> 00:25:25.690
I mean, there's like over 70,000 events
to choose from,

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.893
and all you got to do is add code
DeFranco to your psychic app

00:25:27.893 --> 00:25:30.161
profile
for a chance of the weekly $500 prize.

00:25:30.161 --> 00:25:31.162
No purchase necessary.

00:25:31.162 --> 00:25:32.664
But with that said,
it brings us to the final thing

00:25:32.664 --> 00:25:34.766
we need to talk about today,
and that is DHS spokesperson

00:25:34.766 --> 00:25:37.168
Tricia McLaughlin is resigning
after falsely claiming

00:25:37.168 --> 00:25:40.171
that a woman killed by Ice
committed an act of domestic terrorism

00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:42.474
without you have Trump praising her,
a Democrat celebrating,

00:25:42.474 --> 00:25:45.544
and she's being replaced by Lauren Biss,
who's actually the woman from DHS.

00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:47.879
Fact check video is calling journalists
radical hacks.

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:50.649
And this is really just the latest wave
of what we will call DHS turmoil.

00:25:50.649 --> 00:25:52.684
And you have many wondering
what the agency's going to look like

00:25:52.684 --> 00:25:53.885
on the other side of this shutdown,

00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:55.453
because you have McLoughlin
officially resigning

00:25:55.453 --> 00:25:57.889
as assistant secretary of public affairs
after just over a year

00:25:57.889 --> 00:26:01.359
serving Under Secretary Kristi Noem
and McLaughlin's also been a major voice

00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:02.193
for the Trump administration's

00:26:02.193 --> 00:26:05.196
hardline immigration agenda
and one of its most passionate defenders.

00:26:05.196 --> 00:26:08.433
She just spent a lot of her time at DHS,
sparring with critics on social media

00:26:08.433 --> 00:26:11.636
and making appearances on Fox News,
CNN, CBS and NPR.

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:14.406
She actually described her work
to her hometown paper last month, saying,

00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:17.609
media is so much of the battle,
so to speak, on the immigration issue.

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:19.611
So much of the debate
is a public relations debate.

00:26:19.611 --> 00:26:20.445
It's a PR war.

00:26:20.445 --> 00:26:22.681
So I'll say also stands out
because Trump recently had an interview

00:26:22.681 --> 00:26:25.417
where he said, you know, his immigration
policy, it's essentially flawless.

00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:26.785
They just have bad PR.

00:26:26.785 --> 00:26:28.019
But also, as far as McLaughlin,

00:26:28.019 --> 00:26:29.988
she's apparently been looking
to get out for a while now.

00:26:29.988 --> 00:26:31.890
In fact, she was reportedly preparing
to leave back in December,

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:34.225
but she stayed on after the fallout
from the killings. Bernie. Good.

00:26:34.225 --> 00:26:34.893
Now it's pretty, though.

00:26:34.893 --> 00:26:36.728
It's also not like
she did a great job there.

00:26:36.728 --> 00:26:38.463
A lot of her statements
turned out to be skewed

00:26:38.463 --> 00:26:40.265
at best, an outright false at worst.

00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:43.501
That includes her claims that Renee Goode
committed an act of domestic terrorism

00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:45.270
before she was shot
and killed by an ice age

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.472
during questioning support of Trump
and his immigration crackdown.

00:26:47.472 --> 00:26:49.474
It earned her allies,
including Donald Trump himself.

00:26:49.474 --> 00:26:52.043
Just last month, you had Trump
showering her with praise and truth social

00:26:52.043 --> 00:26:55.213
after she appeared on Fox, saying
great job by wonderful Trisha McLaughlin,

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.749
DHS assistant secretary on The Sean
Hannity Show.

00:26:57.749 --> 00:27:00.652
Many illegals from around our nation
charged with serious crimes this week.

00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:02.053
Trisha really knows her stuff.

00:27:02.053 --> 00:27:04.022
And so in her statement
confirming McLaughlin's resignation,

00:27:04.022 --> 00:27:06.157
you had Kristi
Noem saying Trisha McLaughlin has served

00:27:06.157 --> 00:27:08.727
with exceptional dedication, tenacity
and professionalism.

00:27:08.727 --> 00:27:11.129
She has played an instrumental role
in advancing our mission

00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:13.164
to secure the homeland
and keep Americans safe.

00:27:13.164 --> 00:27:15.300
But you then also have Democrats
and immigration advocates

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.668
celebrating McLaughlin stepping down.

00:27:16.668 --> 00:27:17.636
House Minority Leader Hakeem

00:27:17.636 --> 00:27:20.705
Jeffries saying another MAGA extremist
forced out of DHS.

00:27:20.705 --> 00:27:21.373
No. Next.

00:27:21.373 --> 00:27:23.341
Also, an attorney who has previously gone
toe to toe with

00:27:23.341 --> 00:27:25.844
McLaughlin, said we are pleased
with this resignation and adding

00:27:25.844 --> 00:27:27.712
unless Pinocchio is applying
for the position,

00:27:27.712 --> 00:27:29.881
we believe her replacement
will be a great improvement

00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:32.817
and hopefully work to start
repairing the credibility of DHS.

00:27:32.817 --> 00:27:34.786
But that then brings us to the person,
Deputy

00:27:34.786 --> 00:27:37.055
Assistant Secretary for Media Relations
Lauren Biss.

00:27:37.055 --> 00:27:38.556
Don't worry,
you probably don't recognize that name,

00:27:38.556 --> 00:27:40.525
but you may recognize her
from the department's fact

00:27:40.525 --> 00:27:43.595
check videos on social media regarding Ice
and law enforcement operations.

00:27:43.628 --> 00:27:46.598
Allegations
that Ice engages in racial profiling are

00:27:46.598 --> 00:27:49.834
disgusting, reckless,
and categorically false.

00:27:50.068 --> 00:27:53.438
CNN should stop running cover
for violent felons

00:27:53.872 --> 00:27:57.542
and start focusing on American victims
of illegal alien crime.

00:27:57.575 --> 00:28:00.812
DHS will not cower to disgusting lies
and smears

00:28:00.812 --> 00:28:03.782
from radical journalists, hacks
and sanctuary politicians.

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:06.818
Secretary
Noem's message to the rioters is clear

00:28:07.118 --> 00:28:10.121
you will not stop us or slow us down.

00:28:10.221 --> 00:28:12.424
Ice and our federal law enforcement
partners

00:28:12.424 --> 00:28:15.794
will not apologize
for enforcing this nation's laws.

00:28:15.994 --> 00:28:18.096
So, you know, based on that, it's
probably unlikely that things

00:28:18.096 --> 00:28:20.298
in the PR department of DHS
are going to change that much.

00:28:20.298 --> 00:28:23.034
But also with us, you know,
we got to know the timing of this shakeup.

00:28:23.034 --> 00:28:26.104
DHS is facing yet another wave of problems
with their lapse in funding,

00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:27.172
thanks to the partial shutdown.

00:28:27.172 --> 00:28:29.074
Right now,
we don't know what the potential reforms

00:28:29.074 --> 00:28:31.743
for Ice and Customs and Border Protection,
where that's going to land.

00:28:31.743 --> 00:28:32.777
So, you know, we're gonna have to wait

00:28:32.777 --> 00:28:35.080
to see where things
land, how things play out.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.083
But also, I think Democrats might be
a little bit premature in celebrating.

00:28:38.083 --> 00:28:39.150
I understand why,

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.286
but it almost appears like there's
some accountability happening,

00:28:41.286 --> 00:28:43.221
which is, in a word,
you don't hear a lot these days.

00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:45.090
And, you know, pressure campaigns work.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.692
DHS is replacing someone
who lied to the public, though.

00:28:47.692 --> 00:28:49.961
They're being replaced with someone
who's likely just going to kind of

00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:52.130
do the same thing,
just maybe in a different font.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:53.765
I mean, McLaughlin's being replaced
by someone

00:28:53.765 --> 00:28:56.768
who claims that any criticism of ice
is disgusting lies and smears.

00:28:56.768 --> 00:28:58.770
He's already on the record
calling allegations of Ice racial

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.840
profiling categorically false
and demanding CNN stop running cover

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.807
for violent felons.

00:29:02.807 --> 00:29:05.176
This is the same playbook
McLaughlin used attack critics,

00:29:05.176 --> 00:29:08.279
defend all actions, and frame
any accountability as anti-American.

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:11.282
But on that happy note, my friends,
it brings us to the end of your Wednesday

00:29:11.282 --> 00:29:12.117
Philip DeFranco show.

00:29:12.117 --> 00:29:12.751
But do not worry.

00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:15.220
Nay, do not fret
because there's more for you to watch.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.423
Just a click away because it is Wednesday,
which means there is a brand new episode

00:29:18.423 --> 00:29:21.559
of crashing out of that podcast
with myself and Alex Pearlman.

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:22.460
Well, I'm very biased.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.295
This week's episode was fantastic.
I think you'll love it.

00:29:24.295 --> 00:29:25.263
So definitely check it out.

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:27.398
But no matter what you do,
I'll see you right back here tomorrow.

00:29:27.398 --> 00:29:29.801
Stay safe, stay informed, stay angry.

00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:32.036
For some reason, everyone has.
To talk about Clickbait killer.

00:29:32.036 --> 00:29:33.872
We'll get to him
later. Contractually, we all have.

00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:36.241
Yeah, I think we do. Here's our app right
here.

00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:39.444
We're either 100% in
fucking full agreement, or you can suck.

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:41.179
Mike. Remember TeamSpeak?

00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:43.481
I remember TeamSpeak,
we go into TeamSpeak.

00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:46.751
Don't worry, $87 million,
and we got all these facilities

00:29:46.751 --> 00:29:48.586
to make sure
that we put all the voters in them.
