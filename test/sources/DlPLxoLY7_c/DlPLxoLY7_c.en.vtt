00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.067
With people down shot dead

00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:04.170
by federal agents in our streets, dozens
more dead in detention centers.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.373
And who knows how many others
beaten or abused.

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:09.609
There is still no indication that Trump's
secret police are slowing down.

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:09.743
right.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:12.412
Because our world so chaotic, there are
a million things happening all at once.

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:13.880
A lot of people, they miss some things.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.983
And so Democrats organized a forum
with three people who were brutalized

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:20.053
by immigration agents while driving
in their cars, all of whom are U.S.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:20.620
citizens.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.023
you know, it's very important
we hear and talk about these things,

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:25.692
especially as a number of platforms
seem to be suppressing things.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:26.326
so with that in mind,

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:29.062
you can hear from the first witness,
Alia Rahman, who experience

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:30.964
what she's about to describe
just three weeks ago.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:33.933
for some additional context, she has
autism and a traumatic brain injury.

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.736
And while she was on her way
to an appointment at TBI Treatment Center,

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:39.539
she says that she came upon a traffic jam
with Ice vehicles.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.010
I had not wanted to pull into a blocked,
chaotic intersection,

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:47.514
but verbally agreed to do so
and rolled down my window.

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:49.749
After an agent yelled move!

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:51.851
I will break your effing window!

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:54.921
Agents on all sides of my vehicle
yelled conflicting threats

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:58.291
and instructions that I could not process
while watching for pedestrians.

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:01.628
Then the glass of the passenger side
window flew across my face.

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:03.863
I yelled, I'm disabled!

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:05.899
At the hands grabbing at me.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.667
And an agent said, too late.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:11.004
I'm by police is able to
get of the doctor up there.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:12.972
An agent

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:16.009
pulled a large combat knife
in front of my face, which I thought

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.780
was for cutting me and later learned
was used to cut off my seatbelt.

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:23.850
Shooting pain went through my head,
neck and wrists.

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:28.054
When I hit the ground face
first and people leaned on my back.

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:30.990
I now cannot lift my arms normally.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.259
then also add her saying
that as they dragged her away,

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.062
she was never asked for ID, never told
she was under arrest,

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:38.665
never read her rights,
and never even charged with a crime.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:41.301
And then she added that
when she was taken into detention,

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:44.471
she got no medical screening,
no phone call and no lawyer.

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:49.042
I was denied a communication navigator
when my speech began to slur.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.247
Agents laughed
as I tried to immobilize my own neck.

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:59.219
I asked for my cane and was told no.

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.422
Pulled up my my arms and prodded forward

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:05.525
and leg irons by agents,
laughing and saying, walk!

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:06.826
You can do it. Walk.

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:08.061
When I was finally placed in

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:11.865
one to be taken to interrogation,
an agent taunted, you were driving, right?

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:12.899
So your legs do work.

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:14.167
I pleaded for emergency

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:17.570
medical care for over an hour
after my vision had become blurry.

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:19.072
My heart rate went through the roof

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:21.274
and the pain in my neck and head
became unbearable.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:22.408
It was denied.

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:25.178
she that also went on to say
that she lost her ability to speak.

00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:28.047
So her cellmate began
pleading with the guards on her behalf.

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:32.318
The last sounds I remember
before I blacked out on the cell floor

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:35.755
were my soul mate banging on the door,
pleading for a medic,

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:40.026
and a voice outside saying,
we don't want to step on ICE's toes.

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:43.496
and then she testified that the next thing
that she knew, she was at a hospital

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.532
where doctors told her
that she had suffered a concussion,

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:48.568
which is, you know, bad enough for anyone
but fucking terrible to hear

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:50.403
if you already have a traumatic brain
injury.

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:52.172
And that, of course, is not where it ends,
because we

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:55.041
then heard from our second witness,
Daniel Rascon, with Daniel.

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:56.976
He says that last August,
when he was running an errand

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:59.979
with his future father in law, Francisco,
and his future brother in law, Jonathan,

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.682
all of a sudden,
two unmarked trucks boxed in their car.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:06.085
I looked up, thinking, we must be
at a red light or in a traffic jam.

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:10.423
But to my surprise,
I was instead met with form

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:14.527
with four men in face, sunglasses

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:18.331
and baseball caps and guns drawn, pointing
straight at us, and so these men

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:19.966
who we said weren't wearing uniforms,
right,

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:23.036
pulling open the car doors,
all while refusing to identify themselves.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:26.573
And then he says that they smashed
the driver's side window, punch Francisco

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:29.609
in the face, and then broke the passenger
side window and reached inside.

00:03:31.444 --> 00:03:34.447
There you can look.

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.082
Terrified for our lives.

00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:39.052
Cisco.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.453
Excuse me?

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:42.789
Francisco bravely
drove through the straight,

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:45.792
through the only open
pathway down the street,

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:50.697
hoping to be driving towards safety
when we were instead met with gunfire.

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:54.367
one of the four men attempted to murder us
after we passed by.

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:58.938
As he fired and made contact with the
passenger side of our car multiple times.

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:02.675
We narrowly escaped as pieces of glass
fell on our heads Daniel

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:06.346
saying that they made it home in a car
riddled with bullet holes and called 911.

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:09.616
And when local police came,
they handcuffed Francisco and questioned

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:10.350
everyone else.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.351
The officers then allowed

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.487
the same four men who had just attacked us
to come to our home.

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:17.857
Those four men were asked to identify
who they were

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:21.494
looking for, but they had zero idea
as to who they were even targeting.

00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:23.563
then two weeks later,
at four in the morning, Daniel says that

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:26.566
he woke up to law enforcement
surrounding his home with assault rifles

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:27.267
and an armored truck,

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:30.536
with everyone inside panicking,
and then the men breaching the front door,

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:32.872
and they began yelling at them
to come out with their hands up.

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:37.210
The agents pointed to bright lasers
attached to their rifles at each of us

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.944
inside the home.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:42.081
They even pointed their weapon at
my fiancée, who was pregnant at the time.

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:43.750
then again, that is not where this ends.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.586
Because we have to hear from our third
witness, Marie Martinez.

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:48.755
and Miss Martinez,
she shared how last November,

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:50.857
she packed a bag of clothing
to donate to her

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:52.759
local church and started driving there.

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.894
But eventually
she came upon a border patrol vehicle.

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:58.898
For the next 15 to 20 minutes,
I followed these Border Patrol agents

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:02.535
through my neighborhood,
honking my horn, shouting out la migra

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:05.772
to warn my neighbors
about the presence of these agents

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:09.375
who have been terrorizing our community
over the past few weeks.

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:13.513
I made eye contact with the driver
of the Border Patrol vehicle and watched

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:18.718
as he turned the steering wheel once again
to his left and sideswiped my vehicle.

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:20.386
Martinez
and saying that she immediately hit

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:22.355
the brakes, as did the Border Patrol
just ahead of her.

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:24.524
And so she tried to escape
for her own safety.

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:28.661
I drove forward and went around the Border
Patrol agents, who jumped out of his car

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.196
and pointed his gun at me.

00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:33.866
the then saying that she drove into the
far left lane, striking the curb and then.

00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:35.068
The next thing I knew.

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:38.304
I felt
a burning sensation in my arms, legs

00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:42.008
and I had been shot by pepper balls,
I could hear my back passenger

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:46.245
when the window shattered
and I felt bullets continue to pierce

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:50.149
my body I looked down and I noticed blood
gushing out of my arms and legs,

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.319
and I realized I'd been shot
multiple times.

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:56.055
Yet despite all of that, somehow
she says that she drove another mile,

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:57.724
then pulled over and called 911.

00:05:57.724 --> 00:05:59.959
But the horror.
It only continued from there.

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:01.127
At the hospital.

00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:05.531
I remember seeing multiple agents
standing around I remember the agents

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:08.501
rushing the nurses to finish up
so they could take me with them.

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:11.137
is after less than three hours there,
she says that she was discharged

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:13.005
and delivered
into the hands of Border Patrol.

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:17.577
one of the agents, came out to me with his
cell phone and took a photograph of me.

00:06:17.577 --> 00:06:21.047
I told them I did not consent
Was this the agent that shot me?

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.548
Was this a trophy for him?

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:25.618
and actually on that note, Democratic
Representative Robert Garcia read aloud

00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:28.855
the text messages that he says were
written by the agent who shot Martinez.

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:31.924
The agent linked an article
about your shooting and texted.

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:33.393
Read it.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:36.362
Five shots, seven holes.

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:39.866
I fired five rounds,
and she had seven holes.

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.868
Put that in your book, boys.

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:45.438
Oh, well, it is what it is.

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:46.706
Shit happens.

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:48.274
Put that in your book, boys. But yeah.

00:06:48.274 --> 00:06:51.444
Getting back to the story,
Martinez says that she started bleeding

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:54.347
through her bandages, and so an FBI agent
had to redress her wounds

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:57.383
and bring her to a second hospital
before taking her back into custody again.

00:06:57.383 --> 00:06:59.419
meanwhile, federal agents took the Border
Patrol vehicle

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.455
that allegedly hit Martinez's
car out of the FBI secure evidence

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:05.658
garage, drove it to Maine and had a Border
Patrol mechanic repair it.

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:07.326
so you have Martinez
arguing that that amounts

00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:09.695
to the destruction of evidence,
especially since her lawyers

00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:11.230
hadn't
been able to inspect the vehicle yet.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.433
there you have the agent who shot her,
testifying that he believed

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:16.636
that the vehicle had no remaining
evidentiary value after it was processed

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:19.405
and released by the FBI and adding,
I was told to pick it up.

00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:20.206
So I picked it up.

00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:23.342
also with, as the government accused her
of trying to ram federal agents with her

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:24.110
car, charged her

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.246
for assault with a deadly weapon,
and labeled her a domestic terrorist.

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:29.482
And although the charges
were dropped back in November,

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:31.851
the government still refers to her
as a domestic terrorist.

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:33.286
On its website. you know her story.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:34.554
It sounds oddly familiar.

00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:37.356
You're not alone there with Martinez
herself making the connection.

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:38.724
I am Rene good.

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:43.896
I am Alex Preti, I am Silverio
Vega Gonzalez, I am Keith Porter.

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:45.531
They should all be here today.

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:48.935
also I'll say speaking of good and pretty,
we're now learning more about the man

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:52.705
who killed them with wired reporting that
two agents belong to highly militarized,

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:55.808
a notoriously aggressive
special response teams or cities.

00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:55.875
right.

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:59.645
Jonathan Ross, who shot Rene
Good, was an ice SRT agent, and Raymundo

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:03.583
Gutierrez was one of the guys who shot
Alex Brady was a CBP SRT agent.

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:07.153
as their name suggests, these units
are meant for special high risk missions.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.621
And so they're patterned off of the US

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:10.990
military special forces teams,
not regular police. right.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.659
Which is why have many saying
that they have not like regular police,

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:17.396
but like soldiers with the outlet writing
they use explosives to breach the doors

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:17.930
of homes.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:18.965
Team members are equipped

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:22.635
with full tactical gear, military style
helmets, assault rifles and heavy duty

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:26.038
crowd control weapons like pepper balls,
foam launchers and flashbang grenades.

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:29.041
they have deployed less lethal munitions
and chemical dispersants with little

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:29.809
or no warning.

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:32.411
Federal agents have charged into crowds
without dispersal orders,

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:35.414
dog piling people who,
after doing nothing more than observing

00:08:35.414 --> 00:08:38.985
or yelling their disapproval at the feds
I also say it's not just cities.

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:41.387
We're also seeing the Border Patrol
tactical unit urban

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:45.658
attack on city streets, which a former CBP
commissioner likened to using a chainsaw

00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:46.492
to mow your lawn

00:08:46.492 --> 00:08:48.895
Because they're an offensive tactical team
traditionally used

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:52.131
for drug raids, counterterrorism missions
and other operations on the border.

00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:54.267
and so when you've got these guys
facing off against middle aged

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:57.303
moms blowing whistles and yelling
shame, you can only imagine

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:58.271
what the outcome is going to be.

00:08:58.271 --> 00:08:59.472
now, I mean, you're getting reports

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:01.641
that these brutal tactics
of these special units,

00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:03.509
they're spreading into Ice and CBP

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:04.143
as a whole,

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:05.044
and that to a certain degree

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:05.945
may explain a lot

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:09.015
of what we've seen over the past year
at why judges are just so fed up

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:11.450
with the outrageous cases
that have been piling on their dockets.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.652
and actually,
what we're talking about that

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:15.321
this is just a nut situation,
you had a judge separating the Justice

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:17.089
Department's lawyers
with a District of Minnesota

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:20.126
to explain why DHS had ignored
so many court orders, including not

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:23.329
releasing several immigrant detainees,
that he had ordered them to release.

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:25.731
But then when a DHS attorney entered
the courtroom,

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:27.867
she ended up giving an answer
nobody was expecting.

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:30.069
she reportedly told the judge,
the system sucks.

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:31.270
This job sucks.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.941
I wish you could hold me in contempt
so that I could get 24 hours of sleep,

00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:38.978
with her, then describing how it's like
pulling teeth to get DHS ice and the DOJ

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:40.846
to follow court orders and explaining

00:09:40.846 --> 00:09:43.516
takes ten emails for me
for a release condition to be corrected.

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:46.786
It takes me threatening to walk out
for something else to be corrected.

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:47.186
and all of that.

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:50.656
As you had NBC reporting that she picked
up 88 cases in less than a month.

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:54.226
So that also may explain
some of her exhaustion, but also in no way

00:09:54.226 --> 00:09:54.961
is she alone, right?

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:57.863
We've seen numerous attorneys
now quitting the DOJ Minnesota office

00:09:57.863 --> 00:10:00.232
because of just how political and insane
things have become.

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:02.234
and then there's more that
we're going to dive into in just a minute.

00:10:02.234 --> 00:10:05.504
But first, let me say, you know, big
shout out to today's sponsor, incognito.

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:07.607
Because your personal information,
it's being exposed

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.342
by companies
that you've never even heard of.

00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:12.311
recent example is a major alarm company
whose third party billing

00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:13.446
partner leaked customer data.

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:16.616
We're talking names, emails, home
addresses, even Social Security numbers.

00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:18.584
in Cockney
helps remove your personal information

00:10:18.584 --> 00:10:22.121
from data brokers and third party sites
that quietly collect, sell and resell

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:22.521
your data.

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:23.356
scammers love stuff

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:26.626
like your full name, phone number, home
address, relatives and work history.

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.494
But in Cockney,
they wipe that out for you.

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:30.162
when I signed up for in Cockney,
I found sites

00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:32.598
I never visited
that somehow knew way too much about me.

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:34.233
the dashboard shows
where your data was found

00:10:34.233 --> 00:10:36.469
and what's been removed without you
spending months sending

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.537
takedown emails, with their custom
removal feature

00:10:38.537 --> 00:10:40.906
on unlimited and family plans,
you can flag any site

00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:42.508
and their privacy agents
handle it for you.

00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:46.545
this matters because even one exposed
profile can lead to spam scams and worse.

00:10:46.612 --> 00:10:48.881
if you want to stop your personal data
from being passed

00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:50.950
around like a party favor,
check out incognito.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:51.984
just scan that QR code

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:56.389
or go to incognito.com/defranco
and use code DeFranco over 60% off.

00:10:56.455 --> 00:10:58.691
incognito. Dot com slash DeFranco.

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:01.327
Code DeFranco. Because scammers can't
steal. It's not there.

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:03.162
but then diving right back into the news.
More news.

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:05.631
You need to know Nick Shirley,
the pro-Trump influencer

00:11:05.631 --> 00:11:08.734
whose viral claims around fraud
involving Somali run daycares,

00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:10.903
which, you know, fueled
weeks of chaos in Minnesota.

00:11:10.903 --> 00:11:12.838
He is now set his sights on California.

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:13.005
right.

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:15.608
He's actually just one of several right
wing content creators

00:11:15.608 --> 00:11:17.009
and even administration officials

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:19.512
who have descended on to the state
with similar allegations,

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:22.214
possibly setting the stage for another
Minnesota style crackdown. Right.

00:11:22.214 --> 00:11:24.116
Because before
you had an army of federal agents

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:26.485
wreaking havoc in the Twin
Cities, you had Democratic Governor Tim

00:11:26.485 --> 00:11:28.654
Walz at the helm
while you had fraudsters making off

00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:30.589
with hundreds of millions of dollars
in state money

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:32.491
meant to help people in need
during the pandemic.

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:32.958
that is, in fact,

00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.393
something that has happened
in many states,

00:11:34.393 --> 00:11:37.063
although the scale
was especially shocking in Minnesota,

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:39.065
what ended up actually happening
as you the Trump administration

00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:42.802
now zeroing in on a years old case
that federal prosecutors had even started

00:11:42.802 --> 00:11:46.105
charging people for way back in 2022
under Joe Biden.

00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:47.773
in the current admin,
they really emphasize

00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:49.709
the involvement
of dozens of Somali Americans,

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.844
even though there are tens
of thousands of them in the state.

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:54.313
know, the fact that a handful of them
were engaged in fraud,

00:11:54.313 --> 00:11:56.582
it's not a reason to believe
that many, many others have.

00:11:56.582 --> 00:11:59.318
But either way, this case,
it was most likely a matter

00:11:59.318 --> 00:12:01.654
for criminal investigators,
not immigration enforcement.

00:12:01.654 --> 00:12:04.824
Especially since 87% of Minnesota's
foreign born Somali

00:12:04.824 --> 00:12:06.692
population are already American citizens.

00:12:06.692 --> 00:12:10.696
but still what you had was Trump calling
Somalis garbage and low IQ, suggesting

00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:13.933
that Congresswoman Ilhan Omar
should be deported, and allegations

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:16.635
of widespread fraud among Somali
and other immigrant communities.

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:17.269
It became part

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:18.471
of that implied justification

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:21.540
for this massive surge of immigration
agents to the state in early December.

00:12:21.607 --> 00:12:24.310
that was especially true after Nick
Shurley claimed to have uncovered a $100

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.446
million fraud scheme involving
Somali child care centers in Minnesota,

00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:31.517
although he did so without providing
any real or at least conclusive evidence.

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:32.418
in fact, the Minnesota

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:35.755
Department of Children, Youth and Families
reported carrying out checks on nine

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.990
child care centers
accused of fraud in Shirley's video

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.226
and found
that all were operating as expected.

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:43.395
though notably, you also had the agency
revealing ongoing investigations

00:12:43.395 --> 00:12:47.133
at for the centers on the list
and in total it is 55 open investigations

00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:49.135
involving providers
that are getting government funding.

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:50.803
and so I say that
because the point isn't to say that

00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:53.539
there are not any issues
and that there isn't any fraud at all.

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:53.606
Right.

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.708
In fact, going back
years, news outlets have published

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:57.610
multiple stories covering
child care fraud.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.812
And several people,
like I said, have been prosecuted.

00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:02.148
but you would surely implying
that this had never been discussed.

00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:06.118
And he manufactured outrage on
unsubstantiated and overblown allegations.

00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:08.187
it was then after his video
that the Trump administration

00:13:08.187 --> 00:13:11.390
moved to send another roughly 2000
federal agents to the city, with it

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.494
then being just two more days until Ice
Agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee.

00:13:15.528 --> 00:13:15.795
Good.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.463
Britain
since then, we've just seen an absolute

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:19.632
flood of videos
appearing to show federal agents violently

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.701
arresting immigrants and citizens,
brutally cracking down on protesters

00:13:22.701 --> 00:13:25.404
and shooting and killing American citizen
Alex Priti.

00:13:25.404 --> 00:13:27.173
then in addition to the chaos
on the ground

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:30.342
with the white House moving to freeze
federal childcare funding for Minnesota

00:13:30.342 --> 00:13:31.977
and five other Democratic led states,

00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:34.547
although you had a federal judge
temporarily blocking that effort.

00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:35.581
now today, we're seeing

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:38.851
borders are Tom Homan saying
that 700 agents will be leaving the state.

00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:41.620
But of course, that brings us to
the question of where will they go next?

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.721
Because you have some saying of the Trump

00:13:42.721 --> 00:13:44.623
administration
and the MAGA influencer machine,

00:13:44.623 --> 00:13:46.992
they may be planning
to follow the same playbook elsewhere.

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:48.961
in fact, to that point,
you reportedly had a senior

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:51.497
white House official telling wired
as far back as last month,

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:53.799
the fraud is so blatant
and widespread in Minnesota

00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:55.467
that it's a good place to start.

00:13:55.467 --> 00:13:56.769
But it's only the beginning.

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:58.671
California and New York next.

00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:01.774
you also had Trump claiming in early
January that California under a governor,

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:02.608
Gavin Newsom,

00:14:02.608 --> 00:14:06.679
is more corrupt than Minnesota and adding
investigation of California has begun.

00:14:06.745 --> 00:14:08.314
And then last week, he created a build

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:09.982
a brand new position
at the Justice Department,

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:12.651
assistant attorney general
for National Fraud Enforcement.

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:14.720
while we hadn't heard much from him yet,
what we do know

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.589
is that Shirley is on the ground
in San Diego

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:19.725
and again, appears to be targeting
Somali run childcare centers.

00:14:19.725 --> 00:14:22.728
he's also reportedly been working
with a woman named Amy Raker to a failed

00:14:22.728 --> 00:14:25.231
politician turned private investigator
who's been showing him around,

00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:27.166
she's also now posted a picture
with Shirley on Twitter.

00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:28.567
Right in California. Here we come.

00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:31.070
When Nick Shirley drops
the video, it's going to be fire.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.106
with that, Shirley appears
to be investigating fraud in California

00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:36.442
the same way that he investigated
fraud in Minnesota,

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:39.578
which was my showing up to daycares
and just asking to see the children,

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:41.513
at least based on the video was posted
online.

00:14:41.513 --> 00:14:44.283
says there's 14 children enrolled here.
You don't care.

00:14:44.283 --> 00:14:45.184
This is my dick.

00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:48.187
And then we're the children.
You don't care.

00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:49.154
Where are the children?

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:51.290
It's not enough. Minnesota, you come here.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.858
it seems like he's
not the only one. Right.

00:14:52.858 --> 00:14:54.860
You had a San Diego smiley daycare workers

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.764
first describing incidents of harassment
and unwanted visitors in early January.

00:14:58.764 --> 00:15:00.633
some reporting that they've had strangers
showing up

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:03.302
and peering through their windows,
asking questions and hurling

00:15:03.302 --> 00:15:06.505
false accusations and ultimately saying
that they're fearing for their safety.

00:15:06.505 --> 00:15:08.507
one, for example,
told AP reporters that she watched

00:15:08.507 --> 00:15:10.743
someone come out from a car
that have been circling the building

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:12.511
and take a shit
near the center's entrance.

00:15:12.511 --> 00:15:16.081
And that same day, someone drove by and
yelled at the center was a fake daycare.

00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:17.116
and so these types of incidents,

00:15:17.116 --> 00:15:18.117
they led to her coming up

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:21.387
with new lockdown procedures
to start budgeting for increased security.

00:15:21.387 --> 00:15:24.490
And she also said that she now keeps
the blinds closed to protect the children

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.026
and people looking in,
as well as to keep them from looking out

00:15:27.026 --> 00:15:30.095
and witnessing potentially scarring scenes
of immigration enforcement in action.

00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:30.229
Brian.

00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:32.498
Also, I'll say a huge thing here
while we're talking about California,

00:15:32.498 --> 00:15:35.601
this trend that surely started
it seems to have gone nationwide.

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:38.671
so cities with large Somali communities
in Washington and Ohio, for example,

00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:40.072
they've also reported incidents.

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:40.606
and in Ohio,

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:43.575
you actually had the Republican governor
holding a news conference to debunk,

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:47.379
right wing influencers claims about fraud
tied to a child care center in Columbus.

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:49.515
Or with the governor saying,
and I don't know why this doesn't

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:52.885
need to be said, a child care provider
refusing to let a stranger

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:56.689
into the building and look at the children
should not be seen as a sign of fraud.

00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:58.157
but also that hasn't stopped Republicans

00:15:58.157 --> 00:16:00.492
in the state legislature
from actually introducing legislation

00:16:00.492 --> 00:16:02.428
to more closely monitor child care
centers.

00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:05.664
that includes one that would require those
that take public money to provide

00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:08.567
live video feeds of their classrooms
to state officials.

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:11.603
but getting back to California
that the fraud allegations have also gone

00:16:11.603 --> 00:16:13.072
beyond daycare facilities.

00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:15.207
you're also seeing pro-Trump influencer
Benny Johnson,

00:16:15.207 --> 00:16:18.377
for example, publishing his own,
documentary this weekend with him

00:16:18.377 --> 00:16:21.380
claiming to have uncovered
a $100 million fraud scheme in California

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.016
tied to what he called
the homeless industrial complex.

00:16:24.016 --> 00:16:26.018
he then also claimed that the state
was using

00:16:26.018 --> 00:16:28.287
these federal dollars
to rig national elections,

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:30.823
although notably, you had California
Governor Gavin Newsom's office

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:33.659
responding to that video
with a detailed fact check, writing,

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:34.827
watch Betty Johnson's video

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:37.496
so you didn't have to lose brain cells
as expected lies.

00:16:37.496 --> 00:16:40.265
Rage made straight from his Russia paid
influencer starter kit.

00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:42.835
as an example, Johnson's
video tries to claim that California's

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:45.604
homeless shelters are mostly filled
with undocumented immigrants.

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:48.140
But his his main piece of evidence
is a phone call

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.843
with a purported whistleblower
whose identity was kept hidden.

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:54.046
you had Newsom's office slamming
the claim as being as real as our free

00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:56.281
Unicorn for All Undocumented
People program.

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:58.584
you've also recently had Mehmet
Oz getting in on the action, right?

00:16:58.584 --> 00:16:59.952
He's part of the Trump administration.

00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:03.155
He's the administrator for the centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:06.158
the also, I guess, possibly relevant
to a conversation about fraud.

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:09.161
He rose to fame in the eyes of many
is something of a modern day

00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:10.095
snake oil salesman.

00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:11.964
Right with his
touting his medical background while

00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:15.868
promoting unsound scientific theories,
unproven treatments and bogus supplements,

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:18.337
sometimes sold by companies
that he had financial ties to.

00:17:18.337 --> 00:17:20.839
in any case, last month
he said that CMS would withhold

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:23.976
around $300 million in funding
from California because, according to him,

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:26.979
it was using the funds on non-emergency
health care for illegals.

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:29.181
then last week,
he published his own documentary style

00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:31.216
video on alleged health care
fraud in California

00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:35.087
involving phony hospices that he suggested
were run by the Russian Armenian Mafia.

00:17:35.087 --> 00:17:35.954
the also, I'll say.

00:17:35.954 --> 00:17:39.658
Notably, neither Oz nor CMS have publicly
shared details that confirm the fraud.

00:17:39.658 --> 00:17:41.760
and then the whole thing for many becomes
especially problematic

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.729
because Oz's parents came from Turkey,
which,

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.497
like Oz himself, in fact, has refused

00:17:45.497 --> 00:17:47.499
to acknowledge
the history of the Armenian genocide.

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:49.768
and so you actually had Governor
Gavin Newsom's office

00:17:49.768 --> 00:17:52.971
filing a civil rights complaint against Oz
after the video was published, saying

00:17:52.971 --> 00:17:56.141
that Oz spewed baseless
and racially charged allegations.

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:59.378
also funny enough, you had Newsom's office
pointing to the fact that Trump himself

00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:02.381
has actually halted a federal effort
to increase oversight on hospice

00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:04.783
care and root out
fraud and abuse in the industry.

00:18:04.783 --> 00:18:05.717
all of this is notably,

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:08.887
he did not deny that fraud happens,
but he insisted that the state

00:18:08.887 --> 00:18:09.788
was taking action.

00:18:09.788 --> 00:18:12.024
actually with that, you were
the California Attorney General's office

00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:15.861
saying that it has filed criminal charges
against 109 individuals over hospice

00:18:15.861 --> 00:18:18.997
fraud related offenses and launched
dozens of civil investigations.

00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:21.433
as far as fraud tied
IT services for unhoused people.

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:25.104
Just last month, the man was arrested for
getting away with $23 million from L.A.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:25.838
County funds.

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:27.139
and so again, the argument is not

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:30.275
that no fraud is happening anywhere
or that fraud is fake.

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:31.009
Fraud is real.

00:18:31.009 --> 00:18:33.979
There's fraud happening here and there,
and there's a debate to be had about

00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:36.648
whether California or any other state
or the federal government

00:18:36.648 --> 00:18:39.351
is doing enough to combat
but also there are reasons to be skeptical

00:18:39.351 --> 00:18:40.986
about a number of the things
that are being claimed.

00:18:40.986 --> 00:18:42.454
And there's reason to doubt that Trump

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:44.456
and his supporters
are coming at the issue in good faith.

00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:46.458
when especially is
there's a question about whether the issue

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:49.695
is going to be used, again, to justify
some sort of action against California

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:51.597
or other states opposed to Trump's agenda.

00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:52.764
although, you know, one big question

00:18:52.764 --> 00:18:55.334
there is whether Democratic lawmakers
will actually stand in his way,

00:18:55.334 --> 00:18:57.669
which we may find out soon
because Congress is now

00:18:57.669 --> 00:19:01.473
standing on the edge of a cliff named DHS
funding, despite just ending a shutdown.

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:03.909
we're because yesterday, Trump
signed a $1.2 trillion

00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:06.879
funding package of five spending bills
to end the partial government shutdown

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:07.846
that started on Saturday.

00:19:07.846 --> 00:19:10.215
and that after the package
was signed by the Senate on Friday

00:19:10.215 --> 00:19:13.719
and the House cleared it yesterday
at a narrow 217 to 214 margin.

00:19:13.752 --> 00:19:15.554
that means that most government
agencies are funded

00:19:15.554 --> 00:19:17.055
through
the end of the fiscal year in September.

00:19:17.055 --> 00:19:19.525
But also there is a big glaring exception.

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:20.926
The Department of Homeland Security.

00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:24.329
this package actually only provided
funding to DHS to the end of next week

00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:26.198
as a compromise
to get the rest of the funding passed.

00:19:26.198 --> 00:19:28.400
but with Democrats
still demanding changes in Ice operations,

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.969
including that agents
wear body cams and identify themselves,

00:19:30.969 --> 00:19:33.472
get warrants, were arrest
and adhere to a code of conduct

00:19:33.472 --> 00:19:35.073
similar
to state and local law enforcement.

00:19:35.073 --> 00:19:36.842
but they're you're already
seeing Republicans pushing back

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:37.709
against some of those requests

00:19:37.709 --> 00:19:40.779
with, for example, speaker Mike Johnson
saying that the right isn't going to agree

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:43.849
to require judicial warrants
for arrest by immigration officers.

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:45.584
claiming
that administrative warrants are, quote,

00:19:45.584 --> 00:19:47.719
sufficient legal authority
to go and apprehend

00:19:47.719 --> 00:19:50.756
undocumented immigrants and adding
someone is going to be apprehended

00:19:50.756 --> 00:19:52.991
and they run behind a closed door
and lock the door,

00:19:52.991 --> 00:19:54.526
what is I supposed to do at that point?

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:56.195
OG is a locked door.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:57.229
you also have some Republicans

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:59.531
taking a stronger stance
against Democrats generally. Right.

00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:02.734
With Representative Lisa McLean,
chair of the House Republican Conference,

00:20:02.734 --> 00:20:05.837
saying that they had no intention
of bending to the Democrats demands.

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:08.407
saying they're like a spoiled child
that's not getting what they want,

00:20:08.407 --> 00:20:10.909
and throwing a temper tantrum
in the middle of the grocery store.

00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:12.878
You don't reward them
with giving them a candy bar.

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:15.147
and, you know, the partizan gap,
it's pretty wide here.

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:18.283
And there's only a few days to close it
before the February 13th deadline.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.486
if they don't, DHS is going to face
a lapse in funding, which includes

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:24.556
Ice, Customs and Border Protection,
the Secret Service and the Coast Guard.

00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:26.458
the with us
you some having more hope than others,

00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:28.093
including representative Rosa DeLauro

00:20:28.093 --> 00:20:29.828
from Connecticut,
who was among the Democrats

00:20:29.828 --> 00:20:32.264
who voted for the short term solution,
with DeLauro saying.

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:35.267
I believe this is an opportunity
to isolate DHS and go at it,

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.337
hammer and tongs, tooth and nail,
whatever phrase you want to use,

00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:40.739
rather than having to figure out
what the heck is going to happen

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:42.774
to five other bills
and all those departments.

00:20:42.774 --> 00:20:44.543
but also there are those taking a stronger

00:20:44.543 --> 00:20:46.612
stance,
including Jim McGovern from Massachusetts,

00:20:46.612 --> 00:20:49.948
who said, refuse to send another cent
to Stephen Miller or Kristi Noem.

00:20:49.948 --> 00:20:51.683
They are undermining our Constitution.

00:20:51.683 --> 00:20:54.920
And the department they run is murdering
American citizens in the streets.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.256
you then also had Representative Pete
Aguilar from California

00:20:57.256 --> 00:21:00.859
saying we have a list that we want done,
and we aren't settling for half measures.

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:03.095
adding that if Republicans
don't want to come to the table

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:06.231
and negotiate real reform, quote,
then they're going to have to explain

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:08.567
to the American public
why they're shutting down agencies. right.

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:11.169
And then and hearing all this, you're
probably not going to be surprised to hear

00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:11.770
that there are

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.239
those that are less confident
that a solution is going to be found

00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:16.141
in this short
amount of time that Congress has.

00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:17.643
know, you have some on the right
suggesting that, you know,

00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:20.579
the can can be kicked down the road
even further, maybe to March 1st.

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:22.748
but with that, your House
minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries saying

00:21:22.748 --> 00:21:25.350
that option is off the table,
saying that a deal will only be possible

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.586
if Republicans come to the table
in good faith and saying,

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:30.922
we've indicated the types of bold and
transformative changes that are necessary.

00:21:30.922 --> 00:21:32.958
The ball is now in the court
of the Republicans.

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.726
but as we've talked about in other videos,
Republicans

00:21:34.726 --> 00:21:36.995
may drag their feet here
because, you know, ice,

00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:40.666
they're still sitting on the big
beautiful bills gift of $75 billion.

00:21:40.666 --> 00:21:42.367
so that it could keep them afloat
for the year.

00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:44.336
a while, though,
you have the Republicans battling pressure

00:21:44.336 --> 00:21:47.306
from within their own party
coming straight from the top guy himself.

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:50.108
re Trump's recent declaration
that he wants to nationalize elections.

00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:53.145
It's throwing the party into absolute
chaos as they try to spin the president's

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:55.247
words into not an authoritarian attempt

00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:57.516
to exert control
over the outcome of future elections.

00:21:57.516 --> 00:21:58.450
Because we talked about it yesterday,

00:21:58.450 --> 00:21:59.051
you had Trump

00:21:59.051 --> 00:22:01.153
calling in to that Dan Bongino show
where he claimed

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:03.922
that Democrats are bringing in illegal
immigrants so they can win elections.

00:22:03.922 --> 00:22:06.024
And then he made this call to Republicans.

00:22:06.024 --> 00:22:08.827
The Republicans should say,
we want to take over.

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:11.196
We should take over the voting,
the voting.

00:22:11.196 --> 00:22:11.963
And at least

00:22:13.098 --> 00:22:14.366
many 15

00:22:14.366 --> 00:22:17.836
places the Republicans
ought to nationalize the voting.

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:19.237
but then after that clip went viral,

00:22:19.237 --> 00:22:22.474
you had white House press secretary
Caroline Leavitt trying to walk it back.

00:22:22.474 --> 00:22:26.978
What the president was referring to
is the Save act, which is a huge common

00:22:26.978 --> 00:22:30.682
sense piece of legislation
that Republicans have supported,

00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:34.486
that President Trump is committed
to signing into law during his term.

00:22:34.486 --> 00:22:37.522
And he spoke with the speaker directly
about that yesterday about the need

00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:41.993
to get that bill on the floor for a vote,
because it provides very common

00:22:41.993 --> 00:22:45.430
sense measures for voting in our country,
such as voter ID.

00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:49.568
I don't think any rational person
who's being honest with themselves

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:54.139
would disagree with the idea
of requiring citizens of this country

00:22:54.139 --> 00:22:59.177
to present an ID before casting a ballot
in a federal election, or, frankly,

00:22:59.177 --> 00:23:01.813
in any election, and that's something
the president wants to see happen.

00:23:01.813 --> 00:23:02.914
So that's what he was referring to.

00:23:02.914 --> 00:23:05.484
Okay, so a few things that to break down,
to really pick apart here.

00:23:05.484 --> 00:23:07.786
First of all, the sad fact
that Leavitt is talking about

00:23:07.786 --> 00:23:09.388
it would require people to prove
that they are U.S.

00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:10.756
citizens when they register to vote.

00:23:10.756 --> 00:23:13.792
It is literally nothing to do
with federal izing elections.

00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:14.159
and Trump.

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:16.228
I mean, you can double check for yourself
if you want to do that to yourself.

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:18.430
I can listen to Dan Bongino
for an extended period of time.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.899
He never once mentioned
that specific legislation

00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:22.167
during his interview with Bongino.

00:23:22.167 --> 00:23:23.235
Yes. He was throwing out

00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:26.538
claims about non-citizen voting,
but he also said verbatim.

00:23:26.538 --> 00:23:29.307
the Republicans ought to nationalize
the voting.

00:23:29.307 --> 00:23:29.808
all heard it.

00:23:29.808 --> 00:23:31.443
and then after you had Leavitt
making those comments,

00:23:31.443 --> 00:23:34.179
you had Trump doubling down
and literally repeating his call

00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:37.182
to nationalize elections during a press
briefing at the Oval Office.

00:23:37.949 --> 00:23:40.786
Did you mean when you said
that you should nationalize elections

00:23:40.786 --> 00:23:42.154
in which 15 states are you?

00:23:42.154 --> 00:23:43.989
I want to see elections. Be honest.

00:23:43.989 --> 00:23:47.592
And if a state can't run an election,
I think the people behind me

00:23:47.592 --> 00:23:49.194
should do something about it.

00:23:49.194 --> 00:23:49.694
Because, you know,

00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:53.465
if you think about it, a state is an agent
for the federal government in elections.

00:23:53.465 --> 00:23:55.033
I don't know why the federal government

00:23:55.033 --> 00:23:57.969
doesn't do him anyway, Trump
then going on to repeat his false claims

00:23:57.969 --> 00:24:00.739
about the 2020 election
being rigged and crooked, specifically

00:24:00.739 --> 00:24:03.208
mentioning Detroit, Pennsylvania,
and Atlanta as places

00:24:03.208 --> 00:24:05.243
he said had horrible corruption
and adding.

00:24:05.243 --> 00:24:07.479
and the federal government
should not allow that.

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:10.215
The federal government
should get involved.

00:24:10.215 --> 00:24:13.552
These are agents of
the federal government to count the votes.

00:24:13.985 --> 00:24:17.289
If they can't count the votes
legally and honestly,

00:24:17.589 --> 00:24:19.624
then somebody else
should take the Constitution it's,

00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:21.893
you know, it seems like the guy's
making it pretty damn clear

00:24:21.893 --> 00:24:24.196
that he wants to nationalize
at least some elections.

00:24:24.196 --> 00:24:26.698
a desire that it apparently
has nothing to do with the Savak,

00:24:26.698 --> 00:24:29.835
because he also never mentioned it
once during that briefing, either.

00:24:29.835 --> 00:24:33.138
but then even after Trump doubled down
and clearly contradicted Levitt,

00:24:33.138 --> 00:24:35.774
we still saw some Republicans
trying to spin those comments

00:24:35.774 --> 00:24:38.243
to make it sound less,
I don't know, like he's fully drunk.

00:24:38.243 --> 00:24:39.411
The authoritarian Kool-Aid.

00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:40.278
you had Senate Majority Leader

00:24:40.278 --> 00:24:43.515
John Thune reiterating the
the Savak story after Trump's briefing.

00:24:43.515 --> 00:24:47.052
with respect to nationalizing elections,
I think the president has clarified

00:24:47.052 --> 00:24:50.322
what he meant by that,
and that is that he supports the Safe act.

00:24:50.489 --> 00:24:52.858
but then also you had Speaker Johnson
just taking a completely different

00:24:52.858 --> 00:24:54.759
approaches,
fully committing the Trump story

00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:57.429
about the elections and blue states
being rigged or fraudulent. Or Johnson

00:24:57.429 --> 00:25:00.398
specifically mentioning California
and the recent Republican loss there.

00:25:00.398 --> 00:25:03.268
I mean, they hold the elections
open for weeks after Election Day.

00:25:03.268 --> 00:25:06.271
That's just one thing that that bothers
so many people.

00:25:06.271 --> 00:25:09.641
We had three House Republican candidates
who were ahead on Election Day

00:25:09.941 --> 00:25:13.578
in the last election cycle, and every time
a new tranche of ballots came

00:25:13.578 --> 00:25:15.380
in, they just magically whittled away

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.284
until their leads were lost
it looks on its face to be fraudulent.

00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:20.185
Can I prove that?

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:21.253
No, so from here, it's

00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:23.688
just about waiting to see
what these next ten days will bring.

00:25:23.688 --> 00:25:24.689
But in the meantime, you know,

00:25:24.689 --> 00:25:26.892
let me know your thoughts
in those comments down below.

00:25:26.892 --> 00:25:29.060
and then there's even more that
we're gonna dive into in just a minute.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.463
But let me take a second
to thank a sponsor and say, you know,

00:25:31.463 --> 00:25:34.032
I never once left the grocery store
thinking, nailed it.

00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:36.301
thankfully,
I stumbled on today's sponsor Hungryroot.

00:25:36.301 --> 00:25:39.104
Right. The easiest way that I found
to eat healthy without overthinking it.

00:25:39.104 --> 00:25:39.504
hungry routes.

00:25:39.504 --> 00:25:42.173
Like a personal nutrition coach
in a grocery shop or all in one.

00:25:42.173 --> 00:25:44.409
I tell them what I like, what I pay
my goals,

00:25:44.409 --> 00:25:46.311
and they fill my car with food
that fits my life.

00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:48.113
it learns quick
right after a couple of orders,

00:25:48.113 --> 00:25:50.582
it's basically like, yeah,
we know what you like. We got you.

00:25:50.582 --> 00:25:51.950
so if you're trying to eat cleaner,

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:55.120
go high protein, reduce inflammation,
or avoid mystery ingredients,

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.354
Hungryroot plans it for you.

00:25:56.354 --> 00:26:00.125
also the groceries are legit smoothies,
quick lunches, kid snacks like the sucker

00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:01.760
punch, dill chips, and even supplements.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.596
their meats and seafood are high quality.
No hormones, no antibiotics.

00:26:04.596 --> 00:26:07.132
And everything tastes like real food,
not diet punishment.

00:26:07.132 --> 00:26:07.699
And the best part?

00:26:07.699 --> 00:26:09.768
No grocery spiral? No. 6 p.m..

00:26:09.768 --> 00:26:11.269
What do we make? Debate. It's handled.

00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:14.239
even when motivation disappears.
Hungryroot helps you stay on track.

00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:30.789
but then diving right back into the news,
you've got Trump answering questions

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:33.592
about the Epstein files
by dismissing them as a Democrat problem.

00:26:33.592 --> 00:26:35.226
And claiming he's barely even in them.

00:26:35.226 --> 00:26:37.429
Which of course,
we know that that's not at all true.

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:41.099
He's all over them in various capacities,
as are others in his administration.

00:26:41.132 --> 00:26:42.667
what ended up
kind of getting the most attention

00:26:42.667 --> 00:26:44.336
in this situation was when Trump snapped

00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:48.039
at CNN's Kaitlan Collins as she tried
to ask about justice for survivors.

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:50.575
What would you say to people like,
okay, Mr.

00:26:50.575 --> 00:26:52.310
President,
something that people care about.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.545
You know what? What did you say?

00:26:53.545 --> 00:26:56.548
What would you what would you say
to the survivors who feel like they've got

00:26:56.548 --> 00:27:01.319
the worst reporter no wonder CNN
has no ratings because of people like you.

00:27:01.486 --> 00:27:03.154
You know, she's a young woman.

00:27:03.154 --> 00:27:04.823
I don't think I've ever seen you smile.

00:27:04.823 --> 00:27:06.858
I've known you for ten years.

00:27:06.858 --> 00:27:09.661
I don't think I've ever seen a smile on
ask you about survivor.

00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:11.596
You know why?
You know why you're not smiling?

00:27:11.596 --> 00:27:13.832
Because you know
you're not telling the truth.

00:27:13.832 --> 00:27:16.835
And you're,
You're a very dishonest organization,

00:27:17.202 --> 00:27:19.104
and they should be ashamed of you.

00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:20.372
right. Trump ridiculing Collins.

00:27:20.372 --> 00:27:22.641
And then the room just moved on
to discuss health care.

00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:24.309
and so among all the different reactions,

00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:26.077
you had a ton of outrage
that none of the other

00:27:26.077 --> 00:27:28.313
journalists in the room
really said anything to defend her.

00:27:28.313 --> 00:27:30.915
there I will say since it happened
CNN's defended her

00:27:30.915 --> 00:27:33.551
and other reporters have spoken out
online saying things like,

00:27:33.551 --> 00:27:35.920
a reporter asked President Trump
a question he doesn't like.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.956
And instead of answering,
he attacks her character.

00:27:37.956 --> 00:27:40.225
no moments of contrition
for those harmed by Epstein.

00:27:40.225 --> 00:27:42.260
Instead, he has called the files a hoax.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.397
also, Collins's CNN colleague
Jake Tapper noted that this subject it

00:27:45.397 --> 00:27:48.033
it really causes Trump to lash out
because that, you know, that quiet

00:27:48.033 --> 00:27:50.135
piggy remark
he made to a female reporter before

00:27:50.135 --> 00:27:52.470
it was also in response
to an Epstein question.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.339
then Caitlin herself,
she actually kind of responded

00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:57.575
just by sharing a video showing her face
while Trump railed against her.

00:27:57.575 --> 00:28:00.011
And you see her just keeping her cool
and remaining professional.

00:28:00.011 --> 00:28:03.148
also with us, I think it is worth noting
that, you know, his little tirade,

00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:03.882
it came after

00:28:03.882 --> 00:28:07.018
Collins had asked other questions
about Epstein, which Trump did answer,

00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:09.487
but it was clear that he wanted to move on
to a new subject.

00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:10.288
on the polls?

00:28:10.288 --> 00:28:11.589
You talked about Democrats
who were in there.

00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:12.891
Elon Musk was also in there.

00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:14.526
And so was your Commerce secretary, Howard

00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:16.728
Lonoke, and correspondence
that he had with him.

00:28:16.728 --> 00:28:19.998
Did you read those new files that were
published by the Department of Justice?

00:28:19.998 --> 00:28:23.101
I didn't I have a lot of things
I'm doing and a lot of things

00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:26.104
and I don't know,
you mentioned two names.

00:28:26.204 --> 00:28:27.205
I'm sure they're fine.

00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:30.508
I think it's really time for the country
to get on to something else. And.

00:28:30.508 --> 00:28:34.179
And now that, nothing came out about me
other than

00:28:34.879 --> 00:28:38.917
it was a conspiracy against me,
literally, by Epstein and other people.

00:28:39.417 --> 00:28:44.055
But I think it's time now for the country
to maybe get onto something else.

00:28:44.255 --> 00:28:44.489
of course,

00:28:44.489 --> 00:28:45.824
with the way that Trump
and all his people,

00:28:45.824 --> 00:28:48.426
they were fighting against the Epstein
files, how they're releasing

00:28:48.426 --> 00:28:50.495
and messing things up
now, how they're speaking,

00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:53.531
and also how Trump is responding
when Epstein questions come up.

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:56.134
It's making it so that people aren't
going to be able to move on.

00:28:56.134 --> 00:28:57.469
there were also the, the Epstein files.

00:28:57.469 --> 00:28:59.838
While it's
kind of like a pain in his side,

00:28:59.838 --> 00:29:02.440
for pretty much anyone else,
it would be career ending.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.908
actually what we're seeing in places

00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:06.911
where dorms have not been completely
destroyed are some other politicians.

00:29:06.911 --> 00:29:09.380
It's actually messing up their careers.
over in the UK.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.649
Peter Mandelson
just resigned from the Labor Party

00:29:11.649 --> 00:29:13.918
and House of Lords over revelations
and the Epstein files,

00:29:13.918 --> 00:29:16.988
claiming that he doesn't want to cause
further embarrassment for his party.

00:29:16.988 --> 00:29:18.256
Because some of the communication showed

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:21.259
that Madison gave Epstein sensitive
financial and political information, with

00:29:21.292 --> 00:29:25.430
some of that happening in 2009, after
Epstein became a convicted sex offender.

00:29:25.497 --> 00:29:27.799
also allegedly sent Epstein
a confidential document

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:29.501
intended for the prime minister
and accepted

00:29:29.501 --> 00:29:31.669
tens of thousands of dollars
in payments from Epstein.

00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:33.938
And then there was also a photo
that appears to be a mantles

00:29:33.938 --> 00:29:36.808
in depicting him in underwear
alongside a redacted woman or girl.

00:29:36.808 --> 00:29:38.443
so now he's actually under investigation

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:40.845
in the UK for misconduct
while in public office. Right.

00:29:40.845 --> 00:29:42.313
So you have a lot of people
looking at that going,

00:29:42.313 --> 00:29:45.316
how novel of a concept
that a politician resign and face

00:29:45.316 --> 00:29:48.486
real political consequences for
being implicated in this massive scandal.

00:29:48.486 --> 00:29:49.988
they're also going back
to the United States.

00:29:49.988 --> 00:29:52.557
I will say some people are feeling
some pressure here.

00:29:52.557 --> 00:29:54.092
for example, you had Melinda French Gates

00:29:54.092 --> 00:29:57.128
discussing the mentions of her ex-husband
Bill gates and saying.

00:29:57.128 --> 00:29:58.763
whatever questions remain there.

00:29:58.763 --> 00:30:01.866
Of what I don't can't even begin to know
all of it.

00:30:02.267 --> 00:30:05.436
Those questions are for those people
and for even my ex-husband.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.338
They need to answer
to those things, not me.

00:30:08.439 --> 00:30:10.742
Well, and I am so happy to be

00:30:10.742 --> 00:30:16.080
away from all the muck No girl, no girl

00:30:16.681 --> 00:30:22.220
should ever be put in the situation
that they were put in by Epstein.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.489
I remember being those ages
those girls were.

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:26.991
I remember my daughters being those ages.

00:30:26.991 --> 00:30:27.358
gates.

00:30:27.358 --> 00:30:28.626
He's denied any wrongdoing,

00:30:28.626 --> 00:30:30.395
but politicians
on both sides of the aisle,

00:30:30.395 --> 00:30:33.498
they responded to this interview
by kind of echoing that call, saying,

00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:36.067
yes, bill gates and others,
they need to face questioning.

00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:38.303
And you actually have Nancy Mace
seeking to subpoena him.

00:30:38.303 --> 00:30:39.971
you know, whether or not
Epstein's associates,

00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:41.940
those who participated in
or knew of his crimes

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:45.610
or were just connected to him in some way
will actually answer these questions.

00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:46.811
That remains to be seen.

00:30:46.811 --> 00:30:49.714
Even though I will say this
topic doesn't appear to be going anywhere.

00:30:49.714 --> 00:30:52.083
And justice
also seems so far out of reach.

00:30:52.083 --> 00:30:54.252
but that right there. My friends.
You beautiful bastards.

00:30:54.252 --> 00:30:56.487
Where your Wednesday
Philip DeFranco show is going to end.

00:30:56.487 --> 00:30:59.290
Thank you, as always, for being a part
of another daily dive into the news.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:30:59.591
Of course.

00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:00.925
I'll see you right back here tomorrow.

00:31:00.925 --> 00:31:03.394
And in fact,
there's even more you can watch right now.

00:31:06.631 --> 00:31:08.366
Did you just Epstein file?

00:31:08.366 --> 00:31:11.369
Search me. Phil.

00:31:11.903 --> 00:31:12.337
oh wow.

00:31:12.337 --> 00:31:15.340
Who would have thought
that Steve would get addicted to pills?

00:31:16.407 --> 00:31:19.143
I think no it is, it Oh fuck.

00:31:19.143 --> 00:31:21.446
We burn the building down. Shit.
