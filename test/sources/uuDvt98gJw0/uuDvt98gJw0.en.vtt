00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.668
ISIS finally getting out of Minnesota.

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:02.836
Maybe we'll see.

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:05.071
because where we'll actually get started
is with this announcement

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.207
from Trump's borders,
our Tom Homan this morning.

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:10.944
also I apologize in advance is the stage
presence of soggy whole grain bread.

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:12.612
As a result of this surge operation,

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:13.046
we have

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:16.082
greatly reduced the number of targets
for enforcement action

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:20.020
I'm also pleased to report that we're
seeing a notable decrease of unlawful

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.056
agitator activity here in Minneapolis
and overall throughout the state.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.259
With that I have proposed,
and President Trump has concurred,

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:28.595
that this search operation conclude.

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:30.363
with Tom saying
that a significant drawdown

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.699
has already begun this week
and will continue into next week.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.335
Though he also didn't specify
exactly how many agents are leaving.

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:38.271
and that is, you know, at its peak,
there were reportedly some 3000

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:41.641
federal agents there then recently home
and said 700 would leave immediately.

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:44.878
And so it's unclear what number will
actually remain after all said and done.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.513
this also comes
as you have the white House

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:49.182
quietly finishing up all federalized
National Guard troops

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:52.252
at a US cities last month,
namely Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:53.720
But I also like to be very clear here.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.423
That does not mean that ice
is just disappearing from Minnesota,

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:59.426
nor does it mean that Trump's
mass deportation campaign is ending.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.795
Nor does it mean that
the National Guard is gone for good.

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:02.929
actually, it's quite the contrary.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.497
Homan stressed
that the authorities will continue

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:07.801
enforcing immigration law and prosecuting
so-called agitators in Minnesota.

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.903
And as for the National Guard,
you had Trump warning.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.805
we will come back,
perhaps at a much different

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.541
and stronger form
when crime begins to soar again.

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:15.742
Only a question of time.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.944
plus there's still over 2500 garden
D seasons.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:21.448
Technically, they have a nonfederal status
and more guard remain in Memphis

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:24.617
and New Orleans, where Trump funds them,
but the states governors control them.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:27.020
now has hurt Minnesota, the Trump regime's
casting its intervention

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.323
as an unambiguous success, claiming
that they've arrested more than 4000

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:30.824
people there.

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:32.926
but also you've got critics
seeing it very differently, arguing

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:35.128
that it's not a big number
compared to what they're aiming for.

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:36.830
plus,
we have no idea how many of those people

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.598
were actually the worst of the worst,
though

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:42.635
the data suggests, actually very few, CBS
just reported that less than 14%

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:45.572
of the nearly 400,000
immigrants arrested by Ice during Trump's

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:48.808
first year back had charges or convictions
for violent criminal offenses.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:50.076
then also you've got to ask where

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:53.313
even the arguably good arrests
worth all the chaos, unrest,

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:56.416
civil rights violations and needless
deaths and state executions.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:59.853
I mean, they came in like a tornado, left
a beaten and battered city in their wake.

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:00.587
And for what?

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:03.456
and now it looks like the Trump
administration is just ramping up its war

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:06.626
and immigrants in other ways,
But sources telling NBC that over the past

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:09.896
several months, DHS has been exploring
legal methods of stripping citizenship

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:11.998
from naturalized citizens.
are some context?

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:14.634
Naturalization
has been used only in very rare cases,

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.703
usually when someone concealed
their criminal history

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.872
or human rights violations
during their application.

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:21.474
but you got this source saying that
the goal now is to supply the Office

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:24.711
of Immigration Litigation
with 100 to 200 possible cases per month.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:27.180
And that's also been backed up by previous
New York Times reporting. right.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.114
That's actually crazy high

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:32.085
because throughout Trump's entire
first term, he filed a total of 102 cases.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:34.354
and so to pull this off, reportedly,
officials are seeking shortcuts

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:36.523
to speed up the process,
reassigning staff members

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:38.791
and sending experts
to field offices around the country.

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:40.593
you've got that leading to people
fearing that they're going to have

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:43.196
their citizenship stripped
based on technicalities or something

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:45.999
trivial in their background
that Trump's team can use to argue

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.169
that they don't meet the, quote,
good moral character standards set by law.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.971
but also advocates warn that
even if they don't succeed,

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:53.873
the effort
alone could create a climate of fear,

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:56.042
where even millions of citizens
have to think twice

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:58.211
about attending a protest,
posting on social media,

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:00.947
or saying something
critical of the regime's latest thing.

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:03.183
And all of a sudden
they become a target for naturalization.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.984
Because the administration has made it
very clear

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:07.787
they do not care if you are legal
or illegal, criminal or not.

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:08.488
They want you out. Right.

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.990
Trump has asked the Supreme Court
to end birthright citizenship.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.325
He's revoked people's visas.

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:14.027
He's gone after green card holders.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.562
He's halted asylum applications.

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:17.564
He's banned travel
from dozens of countries.

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:20.700
He even apparently singled out
specific ethnic groups like Somalis

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.402
or Haitians for accelerated removals.

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.170
then, of course,
Stephen Miller is known to have pressured

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.373
DHS staff to deport
as many people as quickly as possible,

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:30.944
criminals or not, with him setting
the infamous 3000 arrests per day goal.

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:34.314
so many argue that you only take
this numbers first detail second approach.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.717
If you really don't care about actually
catching criminals or making people safer.

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:40.720
you just want to scrub the homeland
of people who don't look like

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:44.157
certainly both Trump and Miller have, at
the very least, nodded in that direction.

00:03:44.157 --> 00:03:44.290
Right.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.259
I don't need to go down
the list of comments that they've made

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.461
about the Third World
and Western civilization.

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:51.764
but you can see it even more explicitly
in some of their lower level underlings,

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:54.033
especially the folks that are running
their social media accounts.

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:55.268
Because,
I mean, we've talked about it before,

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:58.538
but you have different government agencies
posting a steady stream of content

00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:00.873
that's widely seen by many as Nazi
or white

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:03.076
nationalist, coded things like this
latest Ice recruitment

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.411
ad overlaid with the text,
we'll have our home again,

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.213
which is the title of a white nationalist
song.

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:10.717
you had DHS mouthpiece Tricia McLachlan
claiming that it's just a coincidence,

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:13.886
except the Instagram version of the post
included audio from the song itself

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:14.520
in the background.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.322
well, now we know for sure,
if you didn't already,

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:18.191
that the people
behind this kind of content,

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:21.327
they're not just rogue staffers who got
their hands on some social media handles.

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:21.361
Right.

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:22.862
Because Trump's team
just picked one of them out

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:24.931
at 21 year
old kid by the name of Peyton Rollins.

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:27.667
And they promoted him to one of the top
media communications roles.

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:28.868
or for most of the past year, he's

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:31.070
been the digital content manager
for the Department of Labor,

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.039
a relatively small
part of the executive branch.

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.807
But he clearly has made a name
for himself.

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:36.743
Without taking credit
for the massive banner

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:39.712
featuring Trump's face that you'll find
hung over the department's headquarters.

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:42.348
also, one post that he made featured
11 stars of the same number

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:45.752
is a Confederate flag, as well as a font
known as fracture that was used

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:48.988
in early Nazi government documents
and on the original cover of Mein Kampf.

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:52.025
Then by early January, a colleague flag
nearly 20 examples of post

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:54.227
that included phrases
associated with QAnon

00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:57.263
as well as violent language
and a recurrent anti-Semitic trope.

00:04:57.263 --> 00:05:00.300
also have at times warning that more
than a dozen internal emails and Microsoft

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.703
Teams conversations within the department
expressed similar concerns to superiors.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.174
then, did the leadership fire Rollins
rein a man even take down a post or two?

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:09.375
No. Instead,

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:11.678
they give him a huge promotion,
plucking him out of the Labor Department

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:14.480
and making him digital communications
director for DHS Right.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.716
A department with nearly 15 times
as many employees

00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:18.785
and five times
the number of social media followers,

00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:19.619
so that tells you all that

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:22.622
you need to know about what meritocracy
means for this administration, though

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.190
it also shouldn't be surprising.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.159
I don't think anyone who watched the Pam
Bondi

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.994
hearing
yesterday would claim that she's there

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.929
because she's the most qualified person
for the job.

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:31.531
they're actually speaking about that.

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:34.033
There's one thing that a lot of people
miss from that, that clown show

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:36.969
that's now blown up into a scandal around
whether she's a creep. Right.

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:38.971
Because you may have noticed
that her aides had large

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:41.274
white binders similar
to the one that she had in front of her,

00:05:41.274 --> 00:05:43.242
and they frequently passed your notes
or directed her

00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:45.044
to specific pages in her own materials.

00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:46.979
now, most people,
they just saw that as kind of a that egg.

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.482
Right. Who brings opposition research
to a congressional hearing.

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:51.384
But then a photographer noticed something.

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:51.751
when Bondi

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:55.755
was sparring with Pramila Jayapal,
she had a document titled Jayapal, Pramila

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:57.323
Search History that appeared to list

00:05:57.323 --> 00:06:00.860
the things that the lawmaker had searched
in the DOJ secure Epstein files database.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.128
now you also have Nancy Mace,

00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:04.330
one of the few Republican women
who signed on to the petition

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.299
to release the files early
on, confirming that.

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:09.001
are tracking every file that we open.

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:11.471
And when we open it.

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:12.839
They're tracking everything.

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:15.842
And you can see the way
that they're tracking you

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:17.910
when you're logged in,
if you know where to look.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.613
they give each of us
a login with their name attached to it.

00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:24.717
And every single file that we open,
regardless of if we even read it,

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:28.588
every single file that we open,
that file is tagged with our name.

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:31.524
in response to this, we've seen Democrats
losing their shit with, for example,

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:34.794
Jamie Raskin calling it outrageous or,
well, in and a violation

00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:36.129
of the separation of powers.

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.131
have reason to believe
that it was happening to everybody

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:41.033
who went over there, you also had giant
Hall herself telling Ms.. Now.

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:45.772
why was it that she brought that in in her
binder, which we call her Burn Book?

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:48.107
Right.
Was she going to use that against me?

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:52.545
Did they did they get that document
for every single person?

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:54.647
And what were they going to do with it?

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:56.015
really creepy.

00:06:56.015 --> 00:06:58.885
And every American should be creeped out
by the fact that

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:02.155
the Department of Justice
is spying on members of Congress.

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:04.290
now with all this, when asked about it,
you had House speaker

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.025
Mike Johnson
saying it would be inappropriate

00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:08.528
if the DOJ was monitoring Jayapal
search history.

00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:10.663
But he also added that he hasn't
seen the reports

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:13.332
and didn't want to comment
on unsubstantiated allegations.

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:14.233
and in response to all this,

00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:17.570
you have a Justice Department spokesperson
telling the Hill, DOJ has extended

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.073
Congress the opportunity to review
unredacted documents in the Epstein files

00:07:21.073 --> 00:07:24.544
As a part of that review, DOJ logs
all searches made on its systems

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:26.579
to protect
against the release of victim information.

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:28.047
but with that, you know,
you have critics saying

00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:30.550
even if you buy that explanation,
it still doesn't explain

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.619
why Bondi had those search histories
in her binder at the hearing.

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:34.220
and for her part.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.756
Bunny doesn't appear to have addressed
the scandal yet, though, to be fair,

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:38.558
she seems to have a lot on her plate
right now.

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:40.159
because now both Pam Bondi and Kristi

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:42.061
Noem are being sued for government
censorship.

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:44.931
with a lawsuit alleging that last summer
the pair began targeting speech

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:48.034
related to the locations of Ice operations
and framing their documentation

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:49.569
of agents as violence against them.

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.471
specifically,
you had Bondi saying on Fox News

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.640
that the developer of Ice Block, an app
that allowed users to report ice

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.677
activity, better watch out and claim
that it wasn't protected speech.

00:07:57.777 --> 00:08:00.980
And then just a few months
later, Apple removed that and similar apps

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.849
from its App
Store, and Bondi publicly boasted

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:05.084
that the move was in response
to the DOJ's demands.

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:05.985
According to the complaint.

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.620
also around the same time,
Facebook disabled

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.689
a similar group
called Ice Siding Chicagoland.

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:12.391
And once again, both Bondi
and Nome allegedly took credit for that.

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:14.260
it's, we'll have to see
how that plays out on one side.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.129
You've got the regime saying that
it's defending its agents against doxing.

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:19.966
And on the other side, you've got critics
accusing it of killing free speech.

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:21.934
also whoever's right, one thing's clear.

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:24.237
The Trump regime is losing
the narrative war right now.

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:26.939
poll after poll is showing
a strong majority of Americans agreeing

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:29.976
that Ice has gone too far
and that they're not making people safer.

00:08:29.976 --> 00:08:30.710
with so many independents

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:31.344
souring on Trump

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.446
now, it looks like he's even lost
the political advantage

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:35.147
that he enjoyed over
Democrats on immigration.

00:08:35.147 --> 00:08:38.150
Because according to this new AP survey,
about 30% of people trust Republicans

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.452
to do a better job on the issue.

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:42.922
Another 30% trust Democrats
more in the remaining 40% are split.

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:44.357
of course, you know,
that's just one issue.

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:46.526
And if you zoom out
and ask about performance as a whole,

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:48.694
picture actually gets even worse
for President Trump.

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:51.531
because three separate polls this month
have all come to the same conclusion.

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.900
If an election between Trump
and Biden was held again

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.069
today, Biden would probably win
even Rasmussen, the usually Trump

00:08:57.069 --> 00:09:00.273
friendly pollster, found that
48% of likely voters think that Biden did

00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:03.776
a better job as president, compared
to just 40% who say the same about Trump.

00:09:03.843 --> 00:09:05.611
is a meaningful eight point difference.

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:08.247
but also when it comes
to real potential matchups for 2028,

00:09:08.247 --> 00:09:08.548
we should

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:12.351
talk about this backlash and controversy
because we're going to see this play out.

00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:14.687
and one of the most recent ways it has
is you have tons of people

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:17.723
slamming political commentator
Hassan Piker for how he might be voting,

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.526
because on a recent appearance
on Jennifer Welch's I've Had It podcast.

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:22.828
She brought up some hypothetical
presidential tickets.

00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:27.233
Let's say that Gavin Newsom becomes
the nominee if we make it midterms.

00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:29.035
Devastating.

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:31.337
Do you vote for him over JD Vance?

00:09:33.272 --> 00:09:36.442
I don't know, Well, I'd have to vote
for Gavin Newsom, I wouldn't blame.

00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:39.345
What about you? I'd probably vote
third party.

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:40.913
You would?

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:43.616
Oh, yeah, I mean, I at that point
it doesn't even matter.

00:09:43.616 --> 00:09:47.253
Like,
because my policy on this is, is the same

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:50.256
as, like,
my refusal to endorse Kamala Harris.

00:09:50.489 --> 00:09:55.795
The reason why I did not endorse
Kamala Harris was because she did

00:09:55.895 --> 00:09:59.131
things that were not only unproductive,
but also unconscionable.

00:09:59.198 --> 00:10:01.901
and that it prompted a ton of outrage
and a lot of.

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:03.102
Are you fucking kidding me?

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:03.803
with a lot of people thinking

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:07.106
that Hasan shouldn't be encouraging third
party votes to his massive following.

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:10.576
And so I'm saying things like insanely
irresponsible take, given the harm

00:10:10.576 --> 00:10:12.745
this administration has unleashed
just one year in,

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:16.182
well as can we move on from these left
wing creators that have built a business

00:10:16.182 --> 00:10:18.718
on just hating Democrats?
It helps nobody but themselves.

00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:20.119
you also have tons of people
accusing us on

00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:21.654
of being a grifter, arguing
that he, quote,

00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:23.055
wants Republicans in office

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:24.824
because he gets to cosplay
a revolutionary,

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:26.926
which raises his profile
and makes him more money.

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:28.628
then separately from takes on Hassan.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.963
You had some pushing back
on criticisms of Gavin Newsom.

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:33.666
We're saying, I live in California.
My gay friends have basic rights.

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:35.434
My girlfriend can access
reproductive care,

00:10:35.434 --> 00:10:37.570
and we raise the minimum wage for service
workers.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.405
Spare me the disingenuous bullshit.

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:40.673
but then as far as Hassan, he's

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:43.709
defended himself in a series of posts
saying, do you want free health care?

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:46.312
Do you want free college?
Do you want to stop Israel?

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:49.281
I'll vote for anyone who
sincerely believes in making that happen.

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:51.450
adding, I never said JD
Vance is better than Newsom.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.120
want to believe I said that
because you can't comprehend a world where

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.490
democracy implies asking for concessions
from your elected representatives before

00:10:57.523 --> 00:10:59.725
doing loyalty pledges to them
like a happy serf.

00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:00.726
with a sign, then saying shit.

00:11:00.726 --> 00:11:03.929
Libs who don't care about losing to Trump
now want you to obey in advance

00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:05.631
to their hypothetical establishment
candidate.

00:11:05.631 --> 00:11:08.467
While there isn't even a guarantee
there will be an election two years

00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:11.504
from now using marginalized people
as a cudgel as Gavin threw trans

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:12.471
people under the bus.

00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:14.540
while he had his supporters,
you also had a number of people

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.808
pushing back at that response,

00:11:15.808 --> 00:11:17.343
saying things like,
no one is asking anyone

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:19.979
to obey in advance,
so please come down off the cross.

00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:22.048
fellow panelists
recognize the material difference

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:24.784
for marginalized communities
between a hypothetical Democrat

00:11:24.784 --> 00:11:26.152
and Republican administration.

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:27.620
repeatedly use your large audience

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.089
to flatten the difference,
and it's abject nonsense.

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:30.489
some others.

00:11:30.489 --> 00:11:33.092
Also taking issue with how we frame
Newsom's stance on trans rights.

00:11:33.092 --> 00:11:35.661
with one person saying actual trans person
here, Gavin Newsom

00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:37.063
made a comment about trans athletes

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:39.031
that I don't agree
with, but California is still

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:40.966
one of the best places
to be trans in the country.

00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:41.600
See the difference?

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.904
You don't care about what happens to us,
so stop acting like you speak for us.

00:11:44.904 --> 00:11:45.304
with all this,

00:11:45.304 --> 00:11:48.841
you actually had Jennifer Welch ending up
posting a video in his defense, claiming.

00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:51.844
what Hassan is saying is
we need to build a party

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:57.016
that has an FDR style impact
that really, really impacts

00:11:57.016 --> 00:12:01.454
the lives of people instead of the slow
moving, incremental change that the

00:12:01.454 --> 00:12:06.325
current Democratic Party always proposes
Number one, Hassan is not a politician.

00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:08.761
Number two,
Hassan gets to think whatever he thinks.

00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:13.299
Number three, there is a large
growing number of Americans in Gen Z.

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:16.302
And as millennials that have felt

00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:20.840
completely unseen and left behind
by the two party political system

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.410
who hate and despise how much they suck up

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:29.048
to corporations we have time right now
to have these conversations and to move

00:12:29.548 --> 00:12:33.719
our politicians
to a progressive, populist platform.

00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:36.789
with Welch even going so far as to say
one of the reasons that Democrats lose is

00:12:36.789 --> 00:12:39.158
because they do not listen to
voices like us on pickers.

00:12:39.158 --> 00:12:40.760
was also worth
noting that during the podcast,

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.995
Hasan did preempt any potential backlash,
claiming

00:12:42.995 --> 00:12:45.030
that Democrats might lose
solely because of him.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.866
I am incapable.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.668
There is no singular force

00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:52.671
in this country that is capable of making
or breaking an election.

00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:54.707
And if that was real,

00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:58.477
then it is the most idiotic thing
not to listen to my demands.

00:12:58.477 --> 00:13:00.246
But everybody knows that
that's not real, right?

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:02.548
you know, with all that said, I would
really love to know your thoughts here.

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:05.251
obviously with any election,
whether any local or national,

00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:07.486
I think you should weigh
the difference between the two people.

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:10.489
ideally I'd love a ranked choice system
that brings in more voices,

00:13:10.489 --> 00:13:12.291
different voices.
But that's a whole other video.

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:16.462
and then I'm going to vote for the best
or least worst of the two top options.

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:17.930
Right. It's why I voted for Kamala Harris.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.033
Does she represent everything I want
in the country? No.

00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:24.470
but to thinker argue that a government
and a country led by her versus

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:28.574
Donald Trump would be the exact same thing
with the exact same things happening.

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:30.810
No. I hope most of us can agree.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:34.680
When we look at this last year that
this seems to be the way worse option.

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:37.683
I know, you know, this part is separate
from the the clips that we talked about

00:13:37.683 --> 00:13:41.287
on today's show, but it is an argument
that I've seen just playing out in public.

00:13:41.287 --> 00:13:44.089
but I also think we need to hash out
these disagreements very early on.

00:13:44.089 --> 00:13:45.457
Handle business disagreements.

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:49.061
All the messiness in the primaries
and then when it's one versus one.

00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:51.197
Picking the best
and or least worst option.

00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:54.433
And it's more important than ever
if you are in a battleground state,

00:13:54.433 --> 00:13:57.603
though, it really matters everywhere
because there's so many local elections

00:13:57.603 --> 00:13:58.771
that really matter. like understand.

00:13:58.771 --> 00:14:01.006
I don't wake up
getting excited to compromise.

00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:02.141
but at the end of the day,
someone's going to win.

00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:03.142
Someone's going to get elected.

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:05.010
and if there's even a snowball's
chance in hell

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.846
that my vote can go to the person
that I think

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:11.217
is the less worse option of the to Maine,
and that changes things.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:12.117
I'm going to do it.

00:14:12.117 --> 00:14:15.187
I understand the feelings, but I have to
I have to think about the practicality.

00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:18.190
But again, this is
this is how I'm operating through life.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.392
Whether you agree or disagree with me,
I love to hear you.

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:23.062
From in Love to hear
from you in the comments down below.

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:25.030
then there's more we're going to dive into
in just a minute.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.464
But first,

00:14:25.464 --> 00:14:28.968
let me thank a sponsor and say, you know,
it's a great start for events in 2026.

00:14:28.968 --> 00:14:29.869
right, like Bruno Mars.

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:34.740
Lady Gaga beats Zach Bryan's our Larson,
Cardi B, Chris Stapleton and more.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.109
we've been giving out $500 every week
for over a year,

00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:38.477
thanks to our sponsor at C geek.

00:14:38.477 --> 00:14:40.546
And somehow some of y'all still haven't
entered for free.

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:42.248
it's been awesome
seeing so many of you. Beautiful bastard.

00:14:42.248 --> 00:14:45.351
Just winning that $500 weekly giveaway

00:14:45.351 --> 00:14:48.487
concerts, games, Broadway shows,
just y'all living your best lives.

00:14:48.487 --> 00:14:51.857
if you haven't entered yet, it just takes
two seconds in next week's $500 winner.

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:52.925
Could be you, receipt geeks,

00:14:52.925 --> 00:14:56.128

and make some memories.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.625
but then diving right back into the news.

00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:27.626
The House just passed a bill

00:15:27.626 --> 00:15:31.397
that could prevent up to 21 million
eligible American citizens from voting.

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:34.500
supporters call it election security,
critics call it voter suppression.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.635
And the truth about what's actually in
this bill is way

00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:38.570
more complicated than either
side wants you to think.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.906
so we're talking about the Save America
Act, an updated

00:15:40.906 --> 00:15:43.909
and expanded version of the Safeguard
American Voter Eligibility Act.

00:15:43.976 --> 00:15:45.744
past the house before,
but never cleared the Senate.

00:15:45.744 --> 00:15:49.848
And this time it's weak through 218
to 213 with only one Democrat, Henry

00:15:49.848 --> 00:15:51.850
Cuellar of Texas,
crossing the aisle to support

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:55.487
so as far as what it actually does on
the surface, it requires photo ID to vote.

00:15:55.487 --> 00:15:57.356
but you know, the bigger
and more consequential piece

00:15:57.356 --> 00:15:59.625
is that it would bar states
from registering people to vote

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:01.360
unless they provide documents proving U.S.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.928
citizenship, a driver's license.

00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:04.563
Almost never enough for most Americans.

00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:06.598
We're talking about a passport
or a birth certificate.

00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:07.766
so here's one of the big problems
with that.

00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:10.269
Only about half of Americans own
a passport, and millions

00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:12.871
don't have easy access to a paper version
of their birth certificate.

00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:15.374
got the Brennan Center for justice
estimating that around 21

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:17.609
million Americans,
roughly 9% of the country,

00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:19.611
don't have ready access
to either document.

00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:21.714
those people we're talking about here,
they are disproportionately

00:16:21.714 --> 00:16:24.350
poor people of color,
young adults between 18 and 24.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.985
And this one actually surprised me.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:28.587
Married women, Because millions of them
have taken their spouses name,

00:16:28.587 --> 00:16:31.190
meaning that their birth certificate
no longer matches their legal name.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.559
the bill does technically allow
for other documents specifically

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:37.062
mentioning real ID compliant IDs,
then there's also a problem there.

00:16:37.062 --> 00:16:39.765
Real IDs are available
to both citizens and non-citizens,

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:42.134
and they don't explicitly
indicate citizenship status.

00:16:42.134 --> 00:16:43.736
so that workaround doesn't actually work.

00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:45.137
to be fair, of supporters of this bill

00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:48.140
that the white House, is it wrong
that voter ID is very broadly popular?

00:16:48.207 --> 00:16:49.842
show that most Americans across party line

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:53.679
support requiring photo ID to vote, and 36
states already have voter ID laws.

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:55.080
also a majority from both parties

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.150
support requiring proof of citizenship
when registering for the first time.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.719
and you've had the administration
pushing hard on the non-citizen

00:17:00.719 --> 00:17:02.988
voting angle with the official white House
account posting.

00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:03.822
American citizens.

00:17:03.822 --> 00:17:06.692
And only American citizens
should decide American elections.

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:09.728
yeah, that is a principle
I think most people agree with the issue

00:17:09.728 --> 00:17:12.197
is that non-citizen voting, it's already
illegal.

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:15.100
Voters are already required to attest
under oath that their citizens and lying.

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.936
It's a federal crime that can lead
to fines, prison and deportation.

00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:19.538
And studies have consistently shown little

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:21.707
to no evidence
that fraud is happening at scale.

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:22.574
even Trump's own voter

00:17:22.574 --> 00:17:25.811
verification initiative has so far found
no evidence of widespread fraud.

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:28.147
then with that you might think,
okay, well, if all that's the case, well,

00:17:28.147 --> 00:17:29.548
why would people support this?

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:31.250
without people
like the head of the University

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.352
of Maryland Center
for Democracy and Civic Engagement.

00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:34.119
Putting it this way, saying

00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:37.156
voter ID gets such broad support
because large majorities of people

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:39.625
have these documents and have them ready
they don't quite realize

00:17:39.625 --> 00:17:41.260
that significant portions
of the public don't

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.096
or that it's hard to get
or that the information is expired.

00:17:44.096 --> 00:17:45.998
to put it in other words,
it sounds reasonable

00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:47.900
until you realize
the burden doesn't fall on you.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.202
also beyond the citizenship
documents requirement.

00:17:50.202 --> 00:17:52.604
There are other provisions in this bill
that deserve attention, right.

00:17:52.604 --> 00:17:55.741
Mail-In voters, they would have to provide
proof of citizenship in person,

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:58.477
adding another hoop
for people who rely on absentee voting.

00:17:58.477 --> 00:18:00.245
states would be required
to share voter rolls

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:03.415
with the Department of Homeland Security
and take new steps to remove non-citizens

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:06.485
from existing roles, which experts warn
could result in eligible citizens

00:18:06.485 --> 00:18:07.986
being unknowingly unregistered.

00:18:07.986 --> 00:18:10.422
And then here's one that should concern
people regardless of party.

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:13.559
The bill would impose criminal penalties
of up to five years in prison

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:15.761
for any election official
who registers an applicant

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:18.530
who fails to provide
documentary proof of citizenship,

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.432
even if that applicant
is actually a citizen.

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:23.402
you're seeing the head of the Bipartisan
Policy Center's elections project warning

00:18:23.402 --> 00:18:26.105
that this risk creating an environment
where election officials

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:28.340
are almost overly compliant,
meaning that officials

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.376
might reject valid registrations
simply out of fear of prosecution.

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:32.311
that's before you factor in that

00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:35.681
verifying the authenticity of citizenship
documents is genuinely difficult.

00:18:35.681 --> 00:18:35.781
right.

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:37.416
Most election offices and DMVs,

00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:40.119
they do not have the training
or the resources to do it reliably.

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:40.986
when also a huge thing

00:18:40.986 --> 00:18:41.453
is that the law

00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:42.788
would take effect immediately

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:43.889
which experts say wouldn't give

00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:46.992
states enough time to implement it
before the November midterms, potentially

00:18:47.025 --> 00:18:49.261
setting up massive legal battles
over the results.

00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:50.462
know as far as the bigger picture
here. Right.

00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:53.198
Realistically, this bill does face
an uphill battle in the Senate.

00:18:53.198 --> 00:18:55.467
Democrats are going to filibuster,
and right now there's not enough

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:57.769
signs that Republicans
are willing to eliminate that option.

00:18:57.769 --> 00:18:58.570
even Republican Senator

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.539
Lisa murkowski of Alaska
has come out against it,

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:02.674
arguing that election issues
should be left to the states.

00:19:02.674 --> 00:19:04.343
which, by the way,
just to just to throw this out

00:19:04.343 --> 00:19:06.211
there, is exactly the argument
that Republicans

00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:09.248
use to kill Democratic
voting bills in 2021 and 2022.

00:19:09.248 --> 00:19:10.682
Mitch McConnell
famously said at that time,

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:12.518
there's nothing broken around the country.

00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:15.154
There's no rational basis
for federalism in this election.

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:16.889
now Trump is explicitly calling

00:19:16.889 --> 00:19:18.757
for the federal government
to nationalize elections.

00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:21.693
So apparently that principle
was what? Bullshit.

00:19:21.693 --> 00:19:23.896
Or maybe it had a shelf life.
also here's the thing.

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:27.399
Even if the slave act dies in the Senate,
experts say that it really doesn't matter

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:28.167
as much as you'd think.

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:31.069
you got the head of the voting rights lab
telling Axios that the bill sends clear

00:19:31.069 --> 00:19:34.740
marching orders for state lawmakers
to enact Trump's extreme elections agenda,

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.942
all with an eye
toward this year's midterms.

00:19:36.942 --> 00:19:39.878
and in fact, we've already seen what
these laws do at the state level. Kansas.

00:19:39.878 --> 00:19:43.415
A similar law led to the suspension
or cancellation of over 30,000 voter

00:19:43.415 --> 00:19:45.817
applications,
about 12% of all applications

00:19:45.817 --> 00:19:48.587
that were submitted before a federal judge
struck it down in 2018.

00:19:48.587 --> 00:19:51.557
Arizona, a comparable law was litigated
all the way to the Supreme Court,

00:19:51.557 --> 00:19:54.660
which left new requirements in place
only for state and local elections,

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.095
potentially blocking
tens of thousands of eligible citizens.

00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:57.696
into New Hampshire.

00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:59.298
At 2024, law reportedly turned away

00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:02.668
more than 200 potentially eligible voters
on Election Day in 2025.

00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:04.870
so then just imagine these policies
spreading across

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.572
multiple states in a federal election
year.

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:08.874
of course, this whole situation, it's
not in its own bubble.

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:10.309
It's not happening in isolation.

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:12.277
Just a few weeks ago,
the FBI raided an election office

00:20:12.277 --> 00:20:13.679
here in Fulton County, Georgia.

00:20:13.679 --> 00:20:16.481
And we're now learning more
about how they tried to justify that raid.

00:20:16.481 --> 00:20:19.084
The unsealed FBI affidavit
used to get the search warrant.

00:20:19.084 --> 00:20:22.688
It was largely based on thoroughly
debunked claims about 2020 election fraud.

00:20:22.688 --> 00:20:24.890
that affidavit also came from Kurt Olsen,

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.893
a guy who played a central role in Trump's
effort to overturn the 2020 election.

00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:29.561
And he was also reportedly described
by people

00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:32.097
inside the first Trump administration
as a fringe menace.

00:20:32.097 --> 00:20:35.834
now, he is Trump's director of election
security and integrity, with access to

00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:38.904
sensitive intelligence agency information
to search for evidence of cheating.

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:42.307
had one source telling Politico
he will find some super classified report,

00:20:42.307 --> 00:20:45.344
say it's evidence of fraud, but really,
it's just completely out of context.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.380
with that, you were the head of fair fight
action, connecting the dots directly,

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.083
repurposing these conspiracy theories
as federal justification

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:53.585
is part of a broader campaign
to relitigate the past

00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:56.588
and lay the groundwork
for interference in the 2026 elections.

00:20:56.588 --> 00:20:59.391
you've got the safe
act is one prong FBI election office raids

00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:02.027
is another an election denier
with intelligence access is a third.

00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:02.794
And a president

00:21:02.794 --> 00:21:06.198
who's already preloaded the narrative
that any election that he loses is rigged.

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:08.533
so when you take all those things together
and you're looking at a world

00:21:08.533 --> 00:21:11.670
where maybe 21 million
eligible voters just can't participate.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.572
or if it's infinitely harder
for them to participate,

00:21:13.572 --> 00:21:16.275
if election officials
are criminally liable for doing their jobs

00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:18.310
at federal agencies
or raiding election offices

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.213
based on debunk conspiracy theories,
that's not election security.

00:21:21.213 --> 00:21:24.349
That is a system being engineered
to produce specific outcomes.

00:21:24.349 --> 00:21:26.818
one of the really frustrating things
is that there are real,

00:21:26.818 --> 00:21:29.187
legitimate conversations
to be had about election integrity.

00:21:29.187 --> 00:21:31.990
most people left and right,
they want secure and fair elections.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.358
but these conversations
are getting poisoned.

00:21:33.358 --> 00:21:34.526
When one side is pushing

00:21:34.526 --> 00:21:37.796
measures that disproportionately target
specific groups of eligible voters

00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:39.398
while providing no meaningful protection

00:21:39.398 --> 00:21:41.967
against the problem,
that evidence of just barely exists.

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:44.336
so I know it's a way, a ways.
But some things you can do

00:21:44.336 --> 00:21:47.239
check your voter
registration status right now@vote.org.

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:49.941
not assume you are registered.
There is trickery afoot.

00:21:49.941 --> 00:21:51.343
also,
if you live in a state considering proof

00:21:51.343 --> 00:21:53.745
of citizenship requirements, contact
your state legislatures

00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:55.947
and make your voice heard
about the concerns that you have.

00:21:55.947 --> 00:21:58.250
also, you can support organizations
working on voting access

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.519
like the Brennan Center,
the Bipartisan Policy Center,

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:02.587
and your local League of Women Voters
chapters.

00:22:02.587 --> 00:22:05.524
really, regardless of where you fall
politically, pay attention to this.

00:22:05.524 --> 00:22:06.558
midterms are coming.

00:22:06.558 --> 00:22:07.893
The stakes are higher than ever,

00:22:07.893 --> 00:22:10.062
and the rules of the game are actively
being rewritten.

00:22:10.062 --> 00:22:11.496
the at least in another act yesterday

00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:13.865
the House did decide at hand trump
a different El.

00:22:13.865 --> 00:22:17.436
the six Republicans joined
most Democrats in a 219 to 211 vote

00:22:17.436 --> 00:22:19.037
to block Trump's tariffs in Canada.

00:22:19.037 --> 00:22:20.839
Trump if you don't remember,
he used a national emergency

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:22.908
to apply the tariffs
and the House resolution here.

00:22:22.908 --> 00:22:24.343
It terminates that emergency order.

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:25.243
you had it being brought forward

00:22:25.243 --> 00:22:27.479
by Democratic Representative
Gregory Meeks in New York,

00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:29.648
who had been arguing that
Canada isn't a threat.

00:22:29.648 --> 00:22:30.916
Canada is our friend.

00:22:30.916 --> 00:22:34.653
And also adding question was simple stand
with working families and lower costs, or

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:37.089
keep prices
high out of loyalty to Donald Trump.

00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:38.557
among the Republicans
who joined this effort,

00:22:38.557 --> 00:22:41.960
you had Nebraska's Don bacon, who thought
the most Republican choice was breaking

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.630
with the president here, writing, tariffs
have been a net negative for the economy.

00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:48.100
adding, as an old fashioned conservative,
I know tariffs

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.536
or attacks on American consumers,
real conservatives oppose tariffs.

00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:53.138
but also here's the twist.

00:22:53.138 --> 00:22:54.973
this probably won't actually change
anything.

00:22:54.973 --> 00:22:57.943
you places like Reuters
calling it an important symbolic vote.

00:22:57.943 --> 00:22:59.678
because you see
even if the Senate follows through

00:22:59.678 --> 00:23:01.847
and they pass
the resolution, Trump can just veto

00:23:01.847 --> 00:23:03.281
and so you had speaker Mike Johnson

00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:05.517
kind of downplaying the vote,
defending Trump's tariffs

00:23:05.517 --> 00:23:07.753
and saying that this won't change
the president's policies.

00:23:07.753 --> 00:23:09.921
but as far as Trump,
he seemed more annoyed.

00:23:09.921 --> 00:23:10.722
writing on truth social.

00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:12.891
Any Republican in the House
or the Senate that votes

00:23:12.891 --> 00:23:16.461
against tariffs will seriously suffer
the consequences come election time,

00:23:16.461 --> 00:23:20.665
and that includes primaries, tariffs have
given us economic and national security,

00:23:20.665 --> 00:23:23.635
and no Republican should be responsible
for destroying this privilege.

00:23:23.635 --> 00:23:23.802
and well,

00:23:23.802 --> 00:23:25.270
of course, there's an unmoving percentage

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:28.273
in this country that takes
whatever Trump says kind of ass to mouth.

00:23:28.273 --> 00:23:30.208
Human Centipede style as the truth.

00:23:30.208 --> 00:23:32.878
it is undeniable that his trade
policy is deeply unpopular.

00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:33.645
repealing from earlier

00:23:33.645 --> 00:23:36.782
this month shows that 60% of Americans
oppose increase in tariffs.

00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:38.650
in fact, estimates show
that they're costing U.S.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.453
households as much as $1,400 every year.

00:23:41.453 --> 00:23:44.623
so the Republicans, they did likely voted
for this measure in hopes that they won't

00:23:44.623 --> 00:23:47.225
face consequences from their voters
when the midterms roll around.

00:23:47.225 --> 00:23:49.161
you places like Bloomberg
saying that this signals

00:23:49.161 --> 00:23:52.297
a growing anxiety over the White House's
economic agenda before elections

00:23:52.297 --> 00:23:56.701
that are expected to focus heavily on
affordability and represents an increase

00:23:56.701 --> 00:23:59.938
in political pressure to change course
on Trump's signature economic policy.

00:23:59.971 --> 00:24:01.840
again,
even though Trump can just veto this,

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.574
it does look like

00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:05.544
the House has even more plans
to stand against these terror policies.

00:24:05.677 --> 00:24:08.380
you have representative Meeks told Axios
that he might try to push votes

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.916
regarding Mexico
and other Liberation Day tariffs.

00:24:10.916 --> 00:24:12.451
so as far as what's next
or what matters here,

00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:14.986
even if none of these resolutions
ultimately become a law,

00:24:14.986 --> 00:24:17.456
they are being used
as a sustained pressure campaign, right.

00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:18.757
Forcing Republican politicians

00:24:18.757 --> 00:24:20.926
to repeatedly go on the record
about whether they support

00:24:20.926 --> 00:24:23.395
policies that are actively hurting
American families.

00:24:23.395 --> 00:24:26.031
well, right now that the cracks in the
Republican party, they're they're small.

00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:26.198
Right.

00:24:26.198 --> 00:24:27.399
We're talking about six votes here.

00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:29.301
is a world where
cracks continue spreading,

00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:32.070
when the economic pain
just keeps piling and piling on.

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:33.772
while that, my friends,
you beautiful bastards.

00:24:33.772 --> 00:24:35.574
Brings us to the end of today's show.

00:24:35.574 --> 00:24:38.543
I have a cool thing to announce. one
for the first time in 2026.

00:24:38.543 --> 00:24:41.079

and two, the first episode of season
two of my podcast in good Faith

00:24:47.953 --> 00:24:49.521

00:24:49.521 --> 00:24:52.257
And it's me sitting down
and talking with Adam Freedland.

00:24:52.257 --> 00:24:54.693

especially because I wanted to start
doing something different with it.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.066
It's old but new. main thing.
