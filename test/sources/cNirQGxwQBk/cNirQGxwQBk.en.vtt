00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:02.068
Hey. Welcome back to the Philip
DeFranco show.

00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:03.670
You daily dive into the news.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.573
It is Monday, February 2nd.
I hope you have a good one.

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.508
There is a lot
we've got to dive into today.

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.843
But first, an announcement.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.811
first beautiful bastard drop at 20, 26.

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:12.879
Just went live.

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.080
And I listened to your, lot of

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.149
you said that you wanted pieces
that felt kind of more rooted.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.251
And in everything
that we're experiencing right now.

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.152
so that's exactly what we did.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:22.355
You get nine new pieces
across TS and long sleep crews.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.958
Police. State of America. Honesty
before loyalty.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.326
Because that's really what we need
more of.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:27.027
Stay rooted.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.062
Resist America in distress.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:32.065
Truth is a lonely road. better
a weed than a trained rose.

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:33.967
And more and more and more. Including.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.169
If you just want to say
I'm about to fucking lose my sanity.

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:38.204
no. Available for you
a beautiful Bascombe top

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.606
links in the description and comments.

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:43.710
But that said, we have so much we've got
to break down today, starting with this.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.010
Trumps.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.380
DOJ is exposing victims,
protecting the perpetrators, possibly

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.449
including Donald Trump himself,
and still failing

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.752
to meet its legal obligation
to release all of the Epstein files.

00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:54.487
that's
why you have so many people saying right

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:57.991
now, after the department has released
another 3.5 million pages of documents,

00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:01.661
along with 2000 videos and 180,000 images,
more than one month

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:05.031
after the December 19th deadline
set by the Epstein Files Transparency Act.

00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:07.901
well Trump officials claim that they have
now fully complied with the law.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.937
Survivors, lawmakers and watchdog groups
say that they're withholding

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:13.273
roughly half of the records
being held by the government. Right.

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:16.142
And that it's not even the only way
that the law may have been broken.

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:17.844
the Epstein Files Transparency Act tests

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:21.014
the government with releasing the files,
but also with protecting the victims.

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:22.449
right, which was also one of the DOJ

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:24.818
original excuses
for refusing to release the files,

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:26.586
even as survivors
calling for their release.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:27.620
when the department published

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.057
this new batch of files on Friday,
they claimed that more than 500 attorneys

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:32.625
and reviewers
had contributed to this effort.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.694
But those files, when they were released,

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:38.498
they contained the full names
of dozens of victims, as well as nearly 40

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:41.801
unredacted nude images of young women
and possibly teenagers.

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:42.335
those photos

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:44.270
appearing to be part
of a personal photo collection,

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.172
some seeming to have been taken
on Epstein's

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:48.508
private island, and the bodies
and faces of people in them.

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:50.643
They were fully visible,
then as far as the names, according

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.045
to a Wall Street Journal analysis,

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:55.181
several women's full names appeared
more than 100 times in the files,

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:58.251
including more than two dozen
who were minors when they were abused.

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:00.220
you also have some files
hiding someone's name,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.423
but then a duplicate file somewhere else,
making their name public, and some.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:06.025
They had personally identifying details
such as bank information

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.261
and home addresses posted
without redactions as well. right.

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:10.897
And overall, you had lawyers
representing more than 200 victims

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:11.998
saying that they reported

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:15.802
thousands of redaction failures on behalf
of nearly 100 individual survivors

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.972
whose lives have been turned upside down
by the DOJ's latest release.

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:21.107
they actually had to ask federal judges
to order

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:22.709
the immediate takedown of the Justice
Department's

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.979
entire Epstein Files website,
writing a letter, saying the DOJ committed

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:29.282
what may be the single
most egregious violation of victim privacy

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:32.986
in one day in United States history,
and saying it is no longer ethical, moral

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:33.653
or responsible.

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:37.757
To attempt to remedy these violations
through DOJ is tortuously tedious game,

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:39.826
saying this was never a complex
undertaking.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:43.363
DOJ has possessed the names of victims
that it promised to redact for months.

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:46.733
There is no conceivable degree
of institutional incompetence sufficient

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:50.670
to explain the scale, consistency and
persistence of the failures that occurred.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.438
now, with all that,
it does seem that many,

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.707
if not most of these mistakes
have been corrected.

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:55.241
of course, you know,

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:56.876
that's not all that reassuring to those

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.012
whose privacy
has already been so flagrantly violated,

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.113
especially when the department

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:03.116
did, in fact, take a lot of time
to heavily redact many of the files.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:05.218
I mean, there's even one image
where a redaction box

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:06.653
appears over the face of Donald Trump,

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:09.455
even though it just seems to be
a shot of him giving a public speech.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:11.324
which then, of course,
makes a lot of people wonder

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:13.860
who that Trump DOJ
is really trying to protect here.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.562
there you had Deputy Attorney General Todd

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:18.598
Blanch, otherwise known as Trump's
former personal defense lawyer, saying.

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:20.066
we did not protect President Trump.

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:22.335
We didn't protect or not protect anybody.

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:27.440
I mean, I think that that we that there's
a a hunger or a thirst for information

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.743
that I do not think will be satisfied
by the review of these documents.

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:33.012
Blanch
also appeared both confused and angry,

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:34.681
when a reporter asked
if the public might learn

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:36.583
the identities of men
who abused young women.

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:37.584
With the help of Epstein.

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:42.322
Is the public going to learn about men
that abused these girls?

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:43.189
Like, what does that mean?

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.192
If we had information,
we meaning the Department of Justice

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:51.864
about men who abused women, we would,
we would we would prosecute them.

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:54.867
There's this built in assumption
that somehow there's this hidden

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:58.171
tranche of information of men
that we know about

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:01.708
that we're covering up or that
we're not we're choosing not to prosecute.

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:02.842
That is not the case.

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:06.279
I don't know whether there are men
out there that abuse these women.

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:07.847
right in there.
You have many saying that just.

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:09.482
That's an insane thing for him to say.

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:11.217
because as much as we don't know
exactly who

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:14.220
and to what extent others were involved
in Epstein's abuse,

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.389
there is ample reason to believe
that there are others

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.792
who need to face consequences, either
for being directly involved in abuse

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.694
or having knowledge of it
and doing nothing.

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:24.397
you know, one of the biggest questions
for many is whether President Donald J.

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:25.431
Trump is one of them.

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:26.532
especially as you have The New York

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:30.770
Times identifying more than 5300 files
containing over 38,000 references

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.674
to Trump, Melania Mar-A-Lago club
and other related words and phrases.

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:34.741
right.

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:36.276
A big jump from the previously released

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.646
Epstein files that included only 130 files
with Trump related references.

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:40.179
Now that said,

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:44.083
some of the new files or copies of emails
and other records of the DOJ or the House

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:45.718
Oversight Committee released
late last year,

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:47.520
then many of the others are just news
articles

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.657
and other publicly available materials
that landed in Epstein's inbox.

00:04:50.723 --> 00:04:52.558
And notably, none of these files included

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:54.727
any direct communication
between Trump and Epstein.

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:57.030
as far as what's new,
you did have one file showing that

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.599
a man who worked for Epstein
told investigators that Trump,

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.801
along with high profile figures
including the former Prince

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:04.404
Andrew and Robert
Kennedy, had visited Epstein's home.

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:06.406
also another contains
handwritten notes from an interview

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:09.575
conducted back in 2019, about one month
after Epstein died in a cell.

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:12.345
And they say that a victim
whose name has been redacted remembers

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:14.647
being driven to Mar-A-Lago to meet Trump
and that Epstein

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.416
said to Trump at the time,
this is a good one,

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:18.484
then you have another file
showing that Epstein emailed

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:21.788
a private investigator in 2001,
suggesting that he had plans to call Trump

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.323
to talk about Virginia Giuffre. her.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.891
Would you for being one of Epstein's most

00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:27.527
well known victims with her
dying from suicide last year.

00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:28.194
And she said that

00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:30.963
she had been lured into Epstein's
where when she worked at Mar-A-Lago.

00:05:30.963 --> 00:05:33.199
there, then also multiple documents,
including allegations

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.134
that Trump raped a child
in these new files.

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:38.504
But many of these are based on unverified
tips received by the FBI.

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:39.105
and so some outlets

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:42.241
are actually not publishing those at all
due to doubts about the credibility.

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:44.944
but we know that you have many arguing
that now we do need to show them.

00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:46.813
We do need to talk about them
because they concern

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:48.081
the president of the United States.

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:48.815
We're saying that you know,

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:51.284
this is a man who had a well-documented
friendship with Epstein.

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:53.720
He's been found
civilly liable for sexual abuse.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.421
And, you know,
you can hear him on tape talking about

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:57.457
you just grab women by the pussy
because you're famous. Right.

00:05:57.457 --> 00:06:00.059
And that is some of these allegations,
mirror ones made by a Jane Doe.

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:02.362
And a lawsuit was filed
against Trump back in 2016.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:03.930
And there
it was alleged that he and Epstein

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.033
rate this girl when she was 13 years old,
although he denied the claims

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.234
and the suit was later dropped.

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:08.634
this includes

00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:12.004
one complaint made by phone in July 2016,
which seems to have been made

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:14.006
by the same lawyer
who represented the Jane Doe.

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:16.642
then there's another document
which now appears to have been taken down,

00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:18.044
which includes a complaint summary

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:21.114
from an FBI tip claiming that
her female friend was forced to perform

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:24.517
oral sex on President Trump
approximately 35 years ago, saying.

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:27.320
she was approximately 13 to 14 years old
when this occurred.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.690
And the friend allegedly bit
President Trump while performing oral sex.

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:32.525
quote,
the friend was allegedly hit in the face

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:33.993
after she laughed about biting him.

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:36.095
The friend said she was also abused
by Epstein.

00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:38.798
file also says that the investigators,
quote spoke with caller

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:42.602
who identified redacted his friend, adding
quote lead was sent to Washington

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:43.803
office to conduct interview.

00:06:43.803 --> 00:06:45.671
it's unclear what,
if anything, came from this.

00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:49.475
Also, another tip summarized in the same
now deleted file claim that Trump held,

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:51.511
quote, calendar
girl parties at Mar-A-Lago,

00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:54.480
where Epstein would bring in children
and Trump would auction them off.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.847
the claiming

00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:58.785
that guests included Elon Musk, Trump's
eldest children, and Alan Dershowitz.

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:00.653
document
also references Bill Clinton alleging

00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:03.723
that he attended Epstein parties
and that he, Trump and others appear

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:05.725
in videos
of what they call criminal activity.

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:06.959
but unlike some of the others, no

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:08.928
contact information was provided
for this to happen.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:11.697
There's no evidence, timeline
or other verification attached.

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:14.133
but that, of course, hasn't
stopped them from going viral online.

00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:15.368
And it's even attracted the attention

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:18.738
of politicians with, for example,
Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego writing

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:22.008
There needs to be a thorough investigation
of each and every one of these claims.

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:22.442
now that's that

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:25.011
in Trump's defense, you had the Trump DOJ
releasing a statement

00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:28.181
saying some of the documents contain
untrue and sensationalist claims

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:30.316
against President Trump
that were submitted to the FBI

00:07:30.316 --> 00:07:31.851
right before the 2020 election.

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:34.420
adding to be clear
that claims are unfounded and false.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.590
And if they have a shred of credibility,
they certainly would have been weaponized

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.724
against President Trump already.

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:42.028
or with that statement, 
hitting a lot of people kind of odd

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:43.496
for a number of reasons, including it,

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:47.033
it sounds like literally Donald Trump's
own personal defense in the past.

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:49.936
but then also, of course, besides Trump,
there are lots of other rich

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:51.537
and powerful people
who come up in these files,

00:07:51.537 --> 00:07:54.540
some also in connection
to direct allegations of sexual abuse.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.742
so, for example,
there are documents describing claims

00:07:56.742 --> 00:07:59.078
against convicted
sex offender Harvey Weinstein,

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:01.280
slide deck
appearing to be an FBI presentation

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.916
of Jeffrey Epstein investigations,
describing an allegation

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:07.653
that Epstein, quote, told an accuser
to give Weinstein a massage, during which

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:09.555
Weinstein told her to take off her shirt.

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:13.326
saying that when she refused, Weinstein
threatened to, quote, get women to come

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:14.026
force her to.

00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:16.429
that same slide includes allegations
that Epstein told an accuser

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:19.632
to give Wall Street billionaire Leon Black
a massage while black was naked,

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:22.301
and that black made another female perform
oral sex.

00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:24.537
it also mentioned Commerce
Secretary Howard Neck,

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:26.305
although it didn't accuse him
of sexual abuse.

00:08:26.305 --> 00:08:28.474
Instead, it described
how one source reported that

00:08:28.474 --> 00:08:31.477
Nick made his money through Ponzi
schemes and money laundering.

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:31.944
without Nick.

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:32.645
Also coming up

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:35.715
elsewhere in the files, with emails
appearing to show Commerce Secretary

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:39.685
Nick and his wife accepting an invitation
to Epstein's island in December of 2012.

00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:42.088
And they plan to arrive by yacht
with their children.

00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:44.056
very notably, that is several years after

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:46.392
Nick previously said
that he had no contact with Epstein.

00:08:46.392 --> 00:08:49.595
Emails also appear to show that Elon Musk
has lied about his past dealings

00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:50.296
with Epstein. Right.

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:52.398
Musk has famously claimed
that Epstein tried

00:08:52.398 --> 00:08:54.567
to get me to go to his island,
and I refused.

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:57.003
but one file that appears to show
that he emailed with Epstein

00:08:57.003 --> 00:09:00.840
to try and plan a visit to Epstein's
island in late 2013 and early 2014.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.677
asking in one email what day slash night
will be the wildest party on your island?

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.813
way that I'll say it, it isn't clear
if the island visits actually took place.

00:09:07.813 --> 00:09:09.415
as far as Musk is continue to defend

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:13.252
himself, claiming Epstein hounded him
relentlessly to go to his pet island.

00:09:13.352 --> 00:09:13.653
for many

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:16.756
you of them saying that his denials,
they continue to sound like an admission

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:19.592
that he knew that something fucked up
was actually happening there.

00:09:19.592 --> 00:09:22.728
but then also as far as other big names,
we got to mention Microsoft billionaire

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:23.462
Bill gates.

00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:26.499
where there's one new email in which
Epstein suggests that he helped gates

00:09:26.532 --> 00:09:29.769
get drugs to, quote, deal with
consequences of sex with Russian girls

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:32.972
and that he helped facilitate
illicit trysts with married women.

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:36.008
also another name worth noting
is Hollywood filmmaker Brett Ratner.

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:38.911
But he hasn't been the busiest
since he was accused of sexual assault,

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:41.781
though he did just direct
the newly released Melania documentary.

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:43.849
but in the new files,
it includes a series of photos

00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:45.818
of Epstein's New York
townhouse with Ratner

00:09:45.818 --> 00:09:47.753
sitting with Epstein
and a woman who's been redacted,

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:50.089
as well as a modeling agent
who associated with Epstein

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:53.926
and who also died by apparent suicide
in 2022, in prison awaiting trial on sex

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:54.794
trafficking charges.

00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:56.996
also others who came up in the files
with some apparent ties

00:09:56.996 --> 00:10:00.833
to Epstein or billionaire Richard Branson,
Google co-founders or Gay Brin,

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:03.869
New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch,
chairman of the 2028

00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:07.573
LA Olympics Casey Wasserman and former
white House counsel under Barack Obama.

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:08.674
Catherine Ruemmler.

00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:11.177
actually on the subject of Democrats,
you had Bill Clinton's name

00:10:11.177 --> 00:10:14.780
appearing in the new files several times,
mostly communications between his staff

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.217
and Glenn Maxwell about travel
and dining plans in the early 2000.

00:10:18.217 --> 00:10:20.419
Before Epstein was convicted in 2008.

00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:22.822
all of that, as you know, the Clintons,
they've denied any wrongdoing

00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:24.056
and they've also refused to comply

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:25.625
with subpoenas from the House
Oversight Committee,

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.294
meaning that there will be a vote soon
to hold them in contempt.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:31.631
Also, you're saying things like right
wing outlets like Fox News trying to link

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:35.868
Zoran Mamdani to Epstein during what's
been described as a resurfaced photo

00:10:35.868 --> 00:10:38.037
linking him to an Epstein
connected publicist.

00:10:38.037 --> 00:10:38.804
with the image showing him.

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:41.474
Donnie at a luncheon for the movie
Get Out, hosted by Patty

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.009
Siegel, a Hollywood publicist

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:45.344
who's already faced backlash
for her relationship with Epstein.

00:10:45.344 --> 00:10:49.015
anyway, you know, in the photo is also mom
Downey's mother, filmmaker Mira Nair.

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:52.618
as Fox News and other right wing
outlets have noted, she is in the finals.

00:10:52.618 --> 00:10:55.655
Writing a 2009 email, Seagal
wrote to Epstein about an afterparty at

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.891
Glenn Maxwell's townhouse that Nero
attended for a film that she had directed.

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.760
that appears
to be the extent of any connection

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.430
so far, though, you've also had fake
AI generated images going around online,

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.234
claiming to show Mamdani as a child
with his mother, Epstein and others, even

00:11:08.234 --> 00:11:11.671
as there are those who do actually have
very well-established links to Epstein.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:12.672
and so it's out of the United States.

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:15.441
One of the most well known
associates of Epstein is the UK's former

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:17.710
Prince Andrew, whose title was stripped
because of all this.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.979
And he also appears
in this new batch of the files

00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:21.280
at least several hundred times.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.849
that includes in the form of these kinds
of disturbing photos of him

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:26.819
kneeling over a woman on the floor
and placing his hand on her stomach.

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:29.822
The files also show that his ex-wife,
Sarah Ferguson, emailed Epstein

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:32.425
for his advice, just two months after
she told London's Evening

00:11:32.425 --> 00:11:33.292
Standard newspaper

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:36.629
that she would have nothing ever
to do with Jeffrey Epstein ever again.

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:39.699
and so actually with all that, you've now
had British Prime Minister Keir Starmer

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:43.069
and several other officials calling on
Andrew to testify before Congress.

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:46.072
and this is you also have a guy named Lord
Peter Mandelson

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:49.341
already announcing his resignation
from Starmers party after the new files

00:11:49.341 --> 00:11:52.912
suggested he was paid $75,000
by Epstein in the early 2000.

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:55.214
meanwhile, abroad,
you're seeing a top official in Slovakia

00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:57.483
resigning his position
after photos and emails revealed

00:11:57.483 --> 00:12:00.653
that he had met with Epstein in the years
after Epstein was released from jail.

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:04.290
also the Crown Princess of Norway is now
had to publicly apologize for keeping ties

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:04.924
with Epstein.

00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:07.059
and ultimately the fallout from this, it's
been global.

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:10.129
And the extent of Epstein's connections,
it seems to just keep growing.

00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:12.565
of course, you know, some of the questions
that still remain is which of these

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:16.435
connections knew or were involved
and will they ever face real consequences?

00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:18.204
that's a question
I will say that Trump's DOJ

00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:19.538
no longer appears interested

00:12:19.538 --> 00:12:21.841
or with plans
continuing to just push back on this idea

00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:23.642
that there is
anything more to be found out.

00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:24.877
there's a lot of correspondence,

00:12:24.877 --> 00:12:27.613
there's a lot of emails,
there's a lot of photographs.

00:12:27.613 --> 00:12:31.717
There's a lot of horrible photographs
that appear to be taken by Mr.

00:12:31.717 --> 00:12:34.153
Epstein or were people around him.

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:37.857
But that doesn't allow us necessarily
to prosecute somebody.

00:12:37.957 --> 00:12:39.725
with us,
you have Democrats slamming the Trump

00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:42.762
DOJ for still keeping around
half of the files locked away.

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:46.132
And with that, you had Representative
Robert Garcia adding, this is outrageous

00:12:46.132 --> 00:12:48.834
and incredibly concerning,
saying they are in violation of the law.

00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:51.437
We are demanding the names of Epstein,
Coconspirators

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:53.973
and the men and pedophiles
who abuse women and girls.

00:12:53.973 --> 00:12:57.409
also, other lawmakers have been concerned
by Trump's repeated mentions and said.

00:12:57.409 --> 00:12:59.545
we've seen is sickening
with serious allegations

00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:01.947
involving the president himself.
If this is what they're willing

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:04.083
to release,
imagine what they're still hiding.

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:06.285
Our investigation is just getting started.

00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:07.753
And then you also had broken out

00:13:07.753 --> 00:13:09.488
announcing
that he and his Republican colleague,

00:13:09.488 --> 00:13:11.590
Thomas
Massie requested to meet with the DOJ

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.593
to learn more about the heavy redactions
and see portions of the files.

00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:15.728
Without these blackouts.

00:13:15.728 --> 00:13:18.230
and you would kind of also threatening
Pam Bondi with impeachment.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.765
but it is not good enough.

00:13:19.765 --> 00:13:21.667
if we don't get the remaining files.

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:27.439
If we do not get the remaining 302 forms,
the remaining prosecution memo from 2019,

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:31.477
and if the survivors are not happy,
then Thomas Massie and I are prepared

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:33.312
to move on. Impeachment or contempt.

00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:35.381
you know, words are words.
Actions are actions.

00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:37.650
And we're gonna have to wait
to see what happens from here.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.419
Are there some real consequences?
Do we get more?

00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:44.857
Will the day ever actually come
where it feels like those in power

00:13:44.924 --> 00:13:46.725
actually want to hold people accountable?

00:13:46.725 --> 00:13:48.194
you know,
with all these recent developments,

00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:51.530
everything that you've seen and heard,
what are your thoughts here?

00:13:51.764 --> 00:13:53.966
then there's more
we've got to dive into in just a minute.

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:54.466
But first,

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:57.670
let me thank a sponsor and say, you know,
there is a very specific adult panic

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.771
that happens when you realize

00:13:58.771 --> 00:14:01.040
the only person responsible
for your health care is you.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.174
that's why today's sponsor is

00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:04.276
doc has become one of the most useful
apps on my phone.

00:14:04.276 --> 00:14:04.343
Right.

00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:07.346
Is that doc is a free app and website
that helps you find and book

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:10.349
high quality in-network doctors
so you can find someone you love.

00:14:10.349 --> 00:14:13.485
talking primary care
dentists, dermatologists, therapists,

00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:16.155
eye doctors, over 200 specialties
all in one place.

00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:18.691
can filter
by insurance, location, specialty.

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.593
And whether you want an in-person
or video visit.

00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:22.328
So you're not rolling
the dice on your health.

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:24.396
you also get access
to verified patient reviews,

00:14:24.396 --> 00:14:27.099
which means you can choose someone
who actually feels like a good fit,

00:14:27.099 --> 00:14:28.500
not just whoever answered the phone.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.437
the best part, you see real time
availability and book instantly.

00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:33.973
No, we'll call you back.
No voice mail. Black hole.

00:14:33.973 --> 00:14:37.276
appointments booked through Zoc doc
usually happen within 24 to 72 hours.

00:14:37.276 --> 00:14:39.111
And you can even grab same day openings.

00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:40.479
love it. I used it myself.

00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:42.982
I booked an appointment faster
than I could decide what to eat for lunch.

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:45.217
Zero friction stop putting off
those doctor's appointments.

A top rated doctor today.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:55.294
That's Zoc Doctor Phil Zacks.com.

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:57.830
Summerville.
This message is sponsored by Zoc doc.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.832
but then jumping back into the news,

00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:02.134
we need to talk about who murdered
Alex Peretti.

00:15:02.134 --> 00:15:02.935
Because you had ProPublica

00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:05.537
revealing their identities
as 43 year old Border Patrol agent.

00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:05.971
Jesus.

00:15:05.971 --> 00:15:09.842
So a who goes by Jesse and 35 year
old Customs and Border Protection officer

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:12.244
Raymundo Gutierrez, writing these photos
that apparently show

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:14.079
their faces
have been spreading like wildfire, though

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:15.948
ProPublica itself
only reported their name.

00:15:15.948 --> 00:15:18.784
So we're still waiting on official
confirmation that these are really them.

00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:21.787
both men are from South Texas,
and neither are actually new hires.

00:15:21.787 --> 00:15:21.954
Right?

00:15:21.954 --> 00:15:25.224
Gutierrez joined back in 2014, and Ochoa
joined in 2018.

00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:25.791
With Gutierrez

00:15:25.791 --> 00:15:27.693
reportedly
working on a special response team

00:15:27.693 --> 00:15:30.863
which conducts high risk operations
like those of police Swat units.

00:15:30.863 --> 00:15:32.998
And as for what we know about Ochoa,
his ex-wife said that

00:15:32.998 --> 00:15:34.800
he graduated from the University of Texas.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.735
Pan American
with a degree in criminal justice

00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:38.938
and had for years
dreamed of working for the Border Patrol.

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:39.371
with her adding

00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:41.340
by the time that they had split apart
in 2021,

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.843
he had become a gun enthusiast with
about 25 rifles, pistols and shotguns.

00:15:44.843 --> 00:15:47.980
now, in response to this, you had Trump's
DHS accusing ProPublica

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.516
of doxing its officers
and putting their lives

00:15:50.516 --> 00:15:52.584
and their family's
lives in serious danger.

00:15:52.584 --> 00:15:54.987
but you were the outlet countering
that concealing the identities

00:15:54.987 --> 00:15:57.289
of mass law enforcement
agents is highly unusual,

00:15:57.289 --> 00:16:00.526
if not illegal, and prevents them from
being held accountable for their actions.

00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:03.095
and to have critics, the agency saying,
hey, let's make these people famous.

00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:03.896
Their names are Jesus.

00:16:03.896 --> 00:16:06.465
So Koa Raymundo
Gutierrez and Jonathan Ross, right.

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:08.400
The the one who shot Renee in good.
the resistance.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.101
They're not lining up.

00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:11.103
We saw protests
in dozens of cities over the weekend,

00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:13.172
including Minneapolis,
Los Angeles and Portland.

00:16:13.172 --> 00:16:15.574
you also have federal judges
pushing back, ordering the feds

00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:18.811
to release unlawfully detained immigrants,
or at the very least, give them a bond

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:21.080
hearing and countless cases,
And that actually brings us

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.382
to a very positive update
in the case of Liam Ramos. Right.

00:16:23.382 --> 00:16:24.183
The the five year old boy

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:27.286
allegedly used as bait by federal agents
to lure his family out of their home.

00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:28.887
and that's because on Saturday,
you had a court ordering.

00:16:28.887 --> 00:16:31.323
Nice to release him from the Texas
detention facility, where he's been

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:34.326
holed up with his father for weeks,
reportedly getting very, very sick.

00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:37.596
you saw the next day, Ice
actually complying, releasing both the boy

00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:39.631
and his father,
who were then personally escorted back

00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:42.334
to Minneapolis by Democratic
Representative Joaquin Castro.

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:45.137
the well so that that's not to say that
Liam's family is in the clear. Right.

00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:49.141
You had deputy AG Todd Blanch actually
suggesting quite the opposite on ABC.

00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:51.276
the immigration law,
the body of immigration

00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:55.047
law, is much different
than than our typical criminal process

00:16:55.214 --> 00:16:58.717
because of the administrative nature
of what we do every day.

00:16:58.884 --> 00:16:59.885
And so to the extent

00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:03.122
that we need to appeal
that judge's decision, I promise we will.

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:04.423
but also with the situation.

00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:06.025
Liam. He's just one kid, right?

00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:09.361
His school district, while celebrating
his release, noted that there are still

00:17:09.361 --> 00:17:12.664
four more of his fellow students
stuck at the same detention facility.

00:17:12.664 --> 00:17:16.268
in fact, with the Marshal project saying
back in December that at least 3800 kids

00:17:16.268 --> 00:17:19.905
under the age of 18, including 20 infants,
had been booked since Trump took office,

00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:21.874
were the director of the Immigrants
Rights Clinic

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:25.244
at Columbia, writing in an op ed
for The New York Times, children at Dilley

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:29.548
with whom I've worked over the past
year, range in age from 2 to 16 years old.

00:17:29.615 --> 00:17:31.950
two year
old boy was breastfeeding in detention.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:35.421
one six year old boy had leukemia, an
eight year old girl began wetting the bed.

00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:37.756
A 14 year old girl engaged in self-harm.

00:17:37.756 --> 00:17:40.392
and adding all of these children
and their parents were detained.

00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:42.761
Despite being eligible for release,
Ice has the authority

00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:45.931
to release these families
who are not flight risks, on parole

00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:46.565
and while seeking

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:49.968
asylum and other humanitarian protections
in the United States, of these children

00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:52.905
or their parents had a criminal history
anywhere in the world.

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:56.241
And this is numerous reports of detailed
the facilities, awful conditions, dirty

00:17:56.241 --> 00:18:00.312
water, worms and food, inadequate medical
care, a lack of meaningful educational

00:18:00.312 --> 00:18:04.349
services, lights kept on 24 hours a day,
guards threatening to separate families.

00:18:04.349 --> 00:18:05.951
in fact,
it's just been reported that two people

00:18:05.951 --> 00:18:09.822
there have active measles cases
with DHS and quarantining anyone suspected

00:18:09.822 --> 00:18:12.491
of having contact with them and barring
all movement within the facility.

00:18:12.491 --> 00:18:14.560
and with all this, you had Senator
Chris Murphy responding.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.162
This is the facility
I was denied entry to a week ago.

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:20.232
Even though I'm the top Democrat
on the committee that funds DHS.

00:18:20.232 --> 00:18:23.068
And I gave them plenty of notice.
I told you they were hiding something.

00:18:23.068 --> 00:18:25.370
They were. Meanwhile,
you're also seeing a ton of scrutiny.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.306
And another ice facility in Baltimore.

00:18:27.306 --> 00:18:29.608
With immigrant advocates
long claiming that detainees

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:31.944
had little to no contact with loved ones
or their lawyers,

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:35.114
little access to food and water,
and they were denied access to medication.

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:37.149
now a video has been circulating
that reportedly shows

00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:39.785
a severely overcrowded holding room
with some people on the floor.

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:41.920
then Maryland Representative
April McClain.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.289
Delaney
managing to get inside to see for herself.

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:45.491
And this is what she described.

00:18:45.491 --> 00:18:49.428
was a not a large room,
not much bigger than the room

00:18:49.428 --> 00:18:53.265
that we are currently in,
with probably 50 people,

00:18:53.565 --> 00:18:57.136
concrete
floors, a bench around the perimeter

00:18:57.336 --> 00:19:03.108
and a makeshift kind of, bathroom
in the middle that had minimal privacy.

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:07.479
really only meant
to hold people for 12 hours,

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.516
and it is being used to hold people for

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:15.053
24, 48, 72 hours or longer, Meanwhile,
according to the New York Times,

00:19:15.053 --> 00:19:18.056
at least 32 people have died
in Ice custody since Trump took office,

00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:20.792
which is even more than Biden's
entire four year term.

00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:20.959
know,

00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:24.530
rather than trying to tamp things down,
you have Trump ramping them up with DHS.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.932
You know, they're just looking to use
all that big, beautiful bail money.

00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:28.033
So as of December,

00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:31.336
Ice is reportedly planning
to buy industrial warehouses in 23 towns

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:34.706
and convert them into detention facilities
that would hold some 80,000 people

00:19:34.706 --> 00:19:35.207
at a time.

00:19:35.207 --> 00:19:37.042
now, since then, they face
political resistance

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:40.145
and public boycotts, with warehouse
sales in Oklahoma and Virginia

00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:42.481
falling apart
after the owners backed out of the deals.

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:44.149
but warehouses or not, Trump's determined

00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:46.084
to bring the Minnesota model
to other states. Right.

00:19:46.084 --> 00:19:49.121
With several hundred federal immigration
agents arriving in Maine last week

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:50.622
to arrest Somali immigrants.

00:19:50.622 --> 00:19:54.526
that is then led to many hunkering down
inside their homes, avoiding work, school

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:57.596
and stores and fear of being snatched up
off the street by masked men

00:19:57.596 --> 00:19:59.431
and ferried off to Texas
or some other state.

00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:02.234
also, according to Ice,
they've arrested some 200 people,

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:05.270
some of whom are reportedly just asylum
seekers with no criminal history.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.072
then after barely a week,
you had Republican

00:20:07.072 --> 00:20:10.075
Senator Susan Collins
announcing that DHS Secretary Kristi

00:20:10.075 --> 00:20:12.611
Noem had told her
that the surge of Ice activity in Maine

00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:15.747
had ended, saying that so-called
normal operations would continue.

00:20:15.747 --> 00:20:18.250
So it's unclear
how safe immigrants there actually are.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:19.952
and then even if ice has left Maine,

00:20:19.952 --> 00:20:22.154
it looks like they're just
going to be moving to Ohio next.

00:20:22.154 --> 00:20:23.155
because according to Ms..

00:20:23.155 --> 00:20:27.259
Now that Trump administration is eyeing
Springfield and yes, that Springfield.

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:28.727
They're eating the dogs.

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:31.496
The people that came
in, they're eating the cats. Right.

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:35.634
Last year, Kristi Noem revoked temporary
protected status for over 330,000 Haitians

00:20:35.634 --> 00:20:38.470
nationwide, setting the expiration date
for midnight tomorrow

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.974
Springfield is home to an estimated 12,000
to 15,000 Haitian.

00:20:41.974 --> 00:20:44.509
So they're reacting the same way
that Maine Somalis are,

00:20:44.509 --> 00:20:46.278
with a local pastor telling ten TV.

00:20:46.278 --> 00:20:49.381
They're making preparations to stay
inside, not to come out of their homes.

00:20:49.381 --> 00:20:50.749
They are afraid for their children.

00:20:50.749 --> 00:20:52.851
Just yesterday,
I had some Haitians in our church

00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:55.153
give me power of attorney
in case they become separated

00:20:55.153 --> 00:20:56.922
from their children
so we can take care of them.

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:59.124
and over the weekend,
you had historian Timothy Snyder

00:20:59.124 --> 00:21:01.193
sounding the alarm,
writing on his Substack.

00:21:01.193 --> 00:21:03.362
To all appearances,
and according to local sources,

00:21:03.362 --> 00:21:06.765
the city is 2 or 3 days
away from a federal ethnic cleansing,

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:10.502
rounded in a hate campaign organized
by the vice president and American Nazis.

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:12.838
then you had him describing the playbook
here, writing,

00:21:12.838 --> 00:21:15.274
mental chaos has been created
where there was none before.

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:16.608
And then that mental chaos

00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:19.678
becomes the justification
for physical chaos drums, large

00:21:19.678 --> 00:21:23.949
deportations, Ice raids that will,
in fact wreck an improving local economy.

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:25.917
then adding
once that physical chaos has been created,

00:21:25.917 --> 00:21:27.452
it will be blamed on the immigrants

00:21:27.452 --> 00:21:29.521
who are no longer there at that point,
so to speak.

00:21:29.521 --> 00:21:31.123
The lie is supposed to become true.

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:32.758
even have Ohio's Republican governor,

00:21:32.758 --> 00:21:35.827
Mike DeWine, coming to the defense
of his nation residents saying.

00:21:35.894 --> 00:21:37.629
people are working,
and they are hard workers.

00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:40.666
So I think from a public policy
point of view, it is a mistake.

00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:42.034
is not in the best interest of Ohio

00:21:42.034 --> 00:21:45.470
for these individuals who are working
and who are workers to lose their status.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.272
Having said that, this is not my decision.

00:21:47.272 --> 00:21:48.774
This is a decision
for the federal government,

00:21:48.774 --> 00:21:50.409
for the president of the United States.

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:52.978
they're also not totally helpless
against Trump's onslaught,

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:55.714
because any day now,
a district judge is expected to rule on

00:21:55.714 --> 00:21:58.750
whether it nome's revocation of TPS
for the Haitians was legal.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:02.487
plus you're seeing Democrats in Congress
trying but struggling to rein ice in

00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:04.022
using what little leverage they have.

00:22:04.022 --> 00:22:06.191
or with their fight to limit ISIS
sweeping power

00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:08.160
now officially
causing a partial government shutdown.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.730
a shutdown that you saw start Friday
at midnight after Democrats refused a vote

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.834
for a broader funding bill, which included
over $64 billion for DHS and less.

00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:17.135
There were reforms for Ice.

00:22:17.135 --> 00:22:19.204
because while a group of bipartisan
lawmakers had announced

00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:21.006
they had reached a deal,
and while seven Democrats

00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:23.642
vowed to vote against a bill
that funded Ice in the wake of the Renee

00:22:23.642 --> 00:22:25.477
Good killing,
the measure ultimately passed.

00:22:25.477 --> 00:22:26.645
The Republican controlled House.

00:22:26.645 --> 00:22:29.448
but then two days later,
you had Alex Brady being shot and killed.

00:22:29.448 --> 00:22:31.583
And that prompted massive outrage
in Washington,

00:22:31.583 --> 00:22:33.318
Senate Democrats,
they demanded that Republicans

00:22:33.318 --> 00:22:35.487
separate the DHS
funding from the larger package

00:22:35.487 --> 00:22:37.456
so that they could negotiate
their demands for Ice

00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:39.124
while funding other key
parts of the government.

00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:40.726
also I'll say,
you know, for some quick context,

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:42.160
you're
usually the way that spending bills work

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.895
is that lawmakers
will write a bunch of smaller

00:22:43.895 --> 00:22:46.098
appropriations bills
that will fund different departments,

00:22:46.098 --> 00:22:48.233
and then they'll kind of
smush those bills together

00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:49.768
and they'll pass them in larger packages.

00:22:49.768 --> 00:22:51.737
and in fact, six of the 12 smaller
appropriations

00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:53.205
bills have already been signed into law,

00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:55.307
ensuring
that the shutdown would only be partial.

00:22:55.307 --> 00:22:55.741
on Friday,

00:22:55.741 --> 00:22:57.676
with the Senate
approving a deal backed by Trump

00:22:57.676 --> 00:22:59.745
that would pass
five of the remaining appropriations

00:22:59.745 --> 00:23:01.279
bills
to fund huge chunks of the government.

00:23:01.279 --> 00:23:03.615
but instead of approving new dollars
for DHS,

00:23:03.615 --> 00:23:06.051
the measure just extended its current
funding levels for two weeks

00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:07.853
so that lawmakers
could negotiate Ice reforms.

00:23:07.853 --> 00:23:11.590
and while the bill successfully passed in
the Senate, 71 to 29, the House lawmakers

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.724
they left Washington.

00:23:12.724 --> 00:23:13.625
so they were unable to vote.

00:23:13.625 --> 00:23:15.694
And because of that,
it triggered the current partial shutdown.

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:16.595
the we also will say even though

00:23:16.595 --> 00:23:18.497
it's partial,
that the package, it's being held up,

00:23:18.497 --> 00:23:20.365
it funds enormous
chunks of the government,

00:23:20.365 --> 00:23:21.666
fact, departments that are impacted here,

00:23:21.666 --> 00:23:24.236
they make up a majority of discretionary
funding and include

00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:26.071
some of the largest federal agencies
in addition

00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:29.975
to DHS, the funding that's been
put on hold includes over $838 billion

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:33.245
in defense spending, as well as money
for the departments of Labor, education,

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:35.647
Health and Human Services,
transportation and State.

00:23:35.647 --> 00:23:36.848
as far as, you know,
what's going to happen

00:23:36.848 --> 00:23:38.884
next with House speaker
Mike Johnson telling reporters

00:23:38.884 --> 00:23:40.986
this day that the House will aim
to pass the Senate bill

00:23:40.986 --> 00:23:43.388
when lawmakers return and Johnson
expressing optimism

00:23:43.388 --> 00:23:46.425
that the lower chamber is going to be able
to end the shutdown at least by Tuesday.

00:23:46.425 --> 00:23:48.427
but also that could prove
to be an uphill battle

00:23:48.427 --> 00:23:49.461
because you have many House

00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:52.697
Dems opposing the short term extension
passed by the Senate, with some saying

00:23:52.697 --> 00:23:54.232
they just don't think
Trump and Republicans

00:23:54.232 --> 00:23:57.602
will negotiate in good faith or agree
to bold enough changes to Ice.

00:23:57.602 --> 00:23:58.937
because, among other things,
you have Democrats

00:23:58.937 --> 00:24:01.573
wanting to enact provisions
that would bar agents from wearing masks,

00:24:01.573 --> 00:24:05.377
require body cameras, ban random sweeps
and searches without warrants, and prevent

00:24:05.377 --> 00:24:06.978
kids from being taken from their families.

00:24:06.978 --> 00:24:09.047
But also beyond that,
some Democrats just don't want to vote

00:24:09.047 --> 00:24:11.516
for any bill
that includes any money for DHS,

00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:13.518
even just an extension of current
funding levels.

00:24:13.518 --> 00:24:14.920
and so in order to pass this bill,
Johnson's

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.256
gonna likely need a near unanimous
vote from his razor thin majority.

00:24:18.256 --> 00:24:20.559
you know, that could also be hard
because many Republicans,

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:22.160
including Johnson himself, have said that

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.262
they oppose
placing new restrictions on Ice

00:24:24.262 --> 00:24:26.164
or other immigration enforcement
concessions.

00:24:26.164 --> 00:24:26.698
then also,

00:24:26.698 --> 00:24:29.701
even if Johnson is able to get
enough votes to pass this measure, there's

00:24:29.701 --> 00:24:30.302
no guarantee

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:32.003
that Democrats and Republicans
are going to be able

00:24:32.003 --> 00:24:32.304
to come to

00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:35.574
any kind of agreement on ice reforms
and funding in the short extension window.

00:24:35.574 --> 00:24:36.274
because of this bill.

00:24:36.274 --> 00:24:38.143
It does go through
while the other agencies

00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:40.612
would get the necessary
funding, lawmakers would only have

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:43.882
until February 13th to reach
some kind of deal for the future of DHS.

00:24:43.882 --> 00:24:46.351
and if they can't reach an agreement,
DHS could shut down

00:24:46.351 --> 00:24:49.154
starting on February 14th,
though, I'll say put an asterisk on that.

00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:50.455
because notably here, while other key

00:24:50.455 --> 00:24:52.424
parts of the department
would be shuttered, like, for example,

00:24:52.424 --> 00:24:55.494
FEMA, Ice would still be able to continue
operating because of Trump's big,

00:24:55.494 --> 00:24:58.697
beautiful bill
allocating $75 billion to the agency.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.899
then also, let's say
there is a world where Democrats

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:02.968
and Republicans,
they come to an agreement and they go,

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:04.903
okay, there's these are the concessions
we're going to do.

00:25:04.903 --> 00:25:06.905
you would then also have to count
on Donald Trump to go.

00:25:06.905 --> 00:25:09.875
Yeah, I'm fine with those concessions
on what I've essentially been using

00:25:09.875 --> 00:25:10.876
as my private army.

00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:12.544
and actually,
on the note of Donald Trump himself,

00:25:12.544 --> 00:25:14.479
we should talk about him
accepting what some are calling

00:25:14.479 --> 00:25:18.016
an obvious bribe from a foreign government
just days before his inauguration.

00:25:18.016 --> 00:25:20.352
because you're saying the Wall Street
Journal just uncovering a half

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:21.286
$1 billion deal

00:25:21.286 --> 00:25:24.456
between an Abu Dhabi prince and the Trump
family's cryptocurrency venture.

00:25:24.456 --> 00:25:25.991
and the specific prince
that we're talking about

00:25:25.991 --> 00:25:29.861
is the Sheikh Ternoon Zayed Al Nahyan,
or the spy chic.

00:25:29.861 --> 00:25:29.961
Right.

00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:32.197
This guy is the brother
of the United Arab Emirates

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:34.399
president, the government's
national security advisor,

00:25:34.399 --> 00:25:37.068
as well as the leader of the UAE's
largest wealth fund.

00:25:37.068 --> 00:25:38.270
oversees an empire valued

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.306
at more than $1 trillion, making him
one of the most powerful single

00:25:41.306 --> 00:25:42.307
investors in the world.

00:25:42.307 --> 00:25:43.108
and for a while now, he's

00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:47.012
been pushing the U.S to allow the UAE
to access tightly guarded AI chips.

00:25:47.012 --> 00:25:50.248
now under the Biden administration,
he was shot down time and time again.

00:25:50.282 --> 00:25:53.285
The UAE was only allowed
a limited number of chips over concerns

00:25:53.285 --> 00:25:55.353
that those chips
could find their way to China.

00:25:55.353 --> 00:25:58.456
in fact, a major area of concern
was one of its own companies

00:25:58.456 --> 00:26:02.761
that I firm, g 42 and its close
ties to sanctioned Chinese tech giants.

00:26:02.827 --> 00:26:06.498
those concerns linger despite the company
saying that they severed ties with China

00:26:06.498 --> 00:26:07.198
a couple of years ago.

00:26:07.198 --> 00:26:08.333
especially considering that

00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:12.237
the UAE and other companies under the spy
chiefs umbrella hadn't yet done the same.

00:26:12.237 --> 00:26:12.571
but anyway.

00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:15.607
Right, that this door was firmly closed
for the UAE under Biden.

00:26:15.607 --> 00:26:18.076
but then when Trump won the election,
that door opened again.

00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:19.778
And to noone immediately
jumped on it. right.

00:26:19.778 --> 00:26:22.047
He held several meetings with Trump
and other U.S.

00:26:22.047 --> 00:26:23.848
officials in the months
following the election.

00:26:23.848 --> 00:26:25.417
that then led to a meeting last March

00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:27.285
at the white House, with noon
reportedly telling U.S.

00:26:27.285 --> 00:26:29.688
officials that he was very excited
to work with the United States.

00:26:29.688 --> 00:26:31.957
And I, as well
as a number of other issues.

00:26:31.957 --> 00:26:34.059
then you flash forward
two months after that meeting

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:35.260
and that Trump administration committed

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.529
to giving the UAE access
to around half a million

00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:39.364
of the most advanced AI chips per year.

00:26:39.364 --> 00:26:41.499
we're making to Nunes vision
of one of the world's largest

00:26:41.499 --> 00:26:44.135
AI data center
clusters is significantly more attainable.

00:26:44.135 --> 00:26:46.171
anyone supporters of this deal
calling it the key

00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:49.274
to opening the floodgates of investment
into the United States and helping

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:51.676
elevate American technology
to the global standard? Right.

00:26:51.676 --> 00:26:52.978
But that, as you have many others calling

00:26:52.978 --> 00:26:56.848
as a major coup by the ruling family,
saying they hurdled over longstanding U.S.

00:26:56.848 --> 00:26:57.949
national security concerns

00:26:57.949 --> 00:27:01.219
and positioned themselves to compete with
the most powerful economies in the world.

00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:03.221
and so already you had red flags waving.

00:27:03.221 --> 00:27:05.557
But then the Wall Street
Journal took it a step further,

00:27:05.557 --> 00:27:08.927
and they made this whole thing
just stink of tried and true corruption.

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:09.027
Right.

00:27:09.027 --> 00:27:10.662
Because what hadn't
been previously reported

00:27:10.662 --> 00:27:12.330
is that months before the chip
deal was made,

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.433
in the days leading up to Trump's
second inauguration, the spy chiefs

00:27:15.433 --> 00:27:18.970
emissary signed a half $1 billion deal
with a Trump family crypto venture.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.872
and he what a crypto company called World
liberty

00:27:20.872 --> 00:27:24.643
financial and to noon backed investment
firm named Aram Investment

00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:28.546
one, purchasing a 49% stake
in the quarter of $1 billion that R.E.M.

00:27:28.546 --> 00:27:30.982
paid up front was reportedly split
three different ways.

00:27:30.982 --> 00:27:34.085
And the biggest chunk of it, right, $187
million, to be specific.

00:27:34.085 --> 00:27:36.554
It's slated to flow into Trump
family entities.

00:27:36.554 --> 00:27:39.324
so you can see how this revelation,
it starts to cause some concern,

00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:41.426
so along with the money
the purchase gave R.E.M.

00:27:41.426 --> 00:27:43.194
two seats on the World Liberty board.

00:27:43.194 --> 00:27:45.296
the reason that's worth mentioning
is because those same

00:27:45.296 --> 00:27:47.132
two executives on the world
Liberty border,

00:27:47.132 --> 00:27:50.135
also on the board of a Ternoon backed
investment firm named.

00:27:50.835 --> 00:27:50.969
right.

00:27:50.969 --> 00:27:52.737
And that firm would later
go on to use World

00:27:52.737 --> 00:27:56.541
Liberty Stablecoin to complete a $2
billion investment in Binance.

00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:58.777
in that deal,
it made World Liberty one of the world's

00:27:58.777 --> 00:28:01.913
largest issuers of stablecoins
and reportedly set them up to generate

00:28:01.913 --> 00:28:03.982
tens of millions of dollars
a year in revenue.

00:28:03.982 --> 00:28:06.985
now that said, Team Trump,
they were very quick to jump in saying

00:28:06.985 --> 00:28:09.487
that there is no conflict of interest
for anyone involved here.

00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:11.389
any would a spokesman for World
Liberty is saying

00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:12.791
that Trump has not been involved

00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:16.027
in world liberty since taking office,
and that this deal doesn't grant anyone

00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:19.564
any sort of access to government decision
making or influence over policy.

00:28:19.564 --> 00:28:22.100
white House saying President Trump
only acts in the best interests

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.034
of the American public,

00:28:23.034 --> 00:28:25.870
saying there are no conflicts of interest,
but those assurances

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.839
haven't stopped experts
from raising the alarm.

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:31.042
and so you're seeing people like Kathleen
Clark, a law professor and former ethics

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:34.212
lawyer, saying that even just the deal
between World liberty and Arrium

00:28:34.212 --> 00:28:37.315
that could violate the Emoluments
Clause of the Constitution, or with Clark

00:28:37.315 --> 00:28:39.784
saying that the clauses intended
to make sure that no U.S.

00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:42.387
government official is, quote,
in the pocket of a foreign government

00:28:42.387 --> 00:28:43.488
and then added this

00:28:43.488 --> 00:28:45.623
it looks like a violation
of the Foreign Emoluments

00:28:45.623 --> 00:28:48.193
clause and more to the point,
it looks like a bribe.

00:28:48.193 --> 00:28:51.296
a then going on to say that
this quote should be a five alarm

00:28:51.296 --> 00:28:53.364
fire about the federal government
being for sale.

00:28:53.364 --> 00:28:55.633
and that is you would a former top
white House attorney adding

00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:57.702
my advice is
an ethics lawyer would have been clear.

00:28:57.702 --> 00:28:59.771
You don't do business deals
with the families

00:28:59.771 --> 00:29:01.239
of the leaders of foreign countries.

00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:02.841
It taints American foreign policy.

00:29:02.841 --> 00:29:04.209
you then also had prominent Democrats

00:29:04.209 --> 00:29:06.611
speaking out against this,
including Senator Elizabeth Warren,

00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:09.080
who said that the Trump family
and their business partners, quote,

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.383
sold out American national security
in order to benefit the president's

00:29:12.383 --> 00:29:15.120
crypto company and added,
this is corruption, plain and simple.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.223
Congress needs to grow a spine and
put a stop to Trump's crypto corruption.

00:29:18.223 --> 00:29:21.426
but that, of course, seems very unlikely
with the current makeup of Congress and,

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:23.495
the relationship between Trump
and the UAE,

00:29:23.495 --> 00:29:26.097
it doesn't appear like it's
going to be slowing down anytime soon.

00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:29.067
really, we just saw
Max become one of the handful of investors

00:29:29.067 --> 00:29:31.336
selected to operate
TikTok in the United States.

00:29:31.336 --> 00:29:34.172
Now, we know that members of the Trump
administration were back in Abu Dhabi

00:29:34.172 --> 00:29:35.073
just a couple of months ago

00:29:35.073 --> 00:29:38.109
to discuss Gaza and Trump's plan
for his so-called Board of Peace.

00:29:38.109 --> 00:29:38.843
but then next.

00:29:38.843 --> 00:29:41.679
Except from that today it's completely
unrelated, but I think it's amazing.

00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:43.114
We need to talk about how market pliers

00:29:43.114 --> 00:29:45.183
independent horror
film could change Hollywood.

00:29:45.183 --> 00:29:47.585
Because if you don't know Markiplier,
he's a huge YouTuber.

00:29:47.585 --> 00:29:49.053
He's kind of one of the OGs.

00:29:49.053 --> 00:29:50.188
and his new movie, Iron Lung,

00:29:50.188 --> 00:29:52.357
which is based on a video game
just released over the weekend.

00:29:52.357 --> 00:29:53.691
And I made around $18

00:29:53.691 --> 00:29:57.629
million domestically, putting it in
second place behind Sam Raimi's and help.

00:29:57.629 --> 00:29:58.863
and this is absolutely huge, right?

00:29:58.863 --> 00:30:00.331
Because he did this himself.

00:30:00.331 --> 00:30:02.801
There's no studio,
no distributor behind the film.

00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:04.569
He pulled this off alone.

00:30:04.569 --> 00:30:07.539
in fact, initially, Iron Lung wasn't
even going to get a very wide release,

00:30:07.539 --> 00:30:10.508
but based on fan demand,
it wound up on 4000 screens.

00:30:10.508 --> 00:30:13.845
Markiplier just told fans, hey, call your
local theaters or request they play it.

00:30:13.845 --> 00:30:14.512
It would be great.

00:30:14.512 --> 00:30:17.715
And that turned into a massive campaign
and eventually a massive release.

00:30:17.782 --> 00:30:19.984
Mark later explaining
they just went to town on it.

00:30:19.984 --> 00:30:21.386
That's what makes me tear up.

00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:24.589
They leapt at an opportunity to help me,
and that's what I'll never forget.

00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:24.923
That's why

00:30:24.923 --> 00:30:28.193
I'll always swear by YouTube and internet
content creation as a platform.

00:30:28.426 --> 00:30:31.062
I don't care about making a profit
on the things that I do for this.

00:30:31.062 --> 00:30:34.332
I'm able to afford to take these chances
that a lot of people aren't able to take.

00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:36.634
I was perfectly content.
If it never got past 50 theaters,

00:30:36.634 --> 00:30:38.603
which for an independent
release is not bad.

00:30:38.603 --> 00:30:41.206
it went to 100,
I thought maybe I could get it to 200.

00:30:41.206 --> 00:30:42.106
I'd be happy with that.

00:30:42.106 --> 00:30:44.442
and then obviously it ended up
playing in many, many more theaters.

00:30:44.442 --> 00:30:46.044
And actually for a second there, Iron Lung

00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:48.213
even seemed like
it was going to come in at the top spot

00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:52.116
because at the Friday box office,
he led on that day with a $9 million home.

00:30:52.116 --> 00:30:54.085
but then I'll say it ended up
getting weirder.

00:30:54.085 --> 00:30:57.121
His stats became temporarily harder
to track as some box office charts

00:30:57.121 --> 00:31:00.625
just stopped listing his film,
with Markiplier even saying on Instagram.

00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:02.327
So this Saturday, right?

00:31:02.327 --> 00:31:03.761
I swear I was on this list,

00:31:04.829 --> 00:31:07.265
but Iron Lung isn't here anymore.

00:31:07.265 --> 00:31:09.200
There's no numbers for Iron Lung.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.203
It took me off the chart and I thought,
hey, maybe that's a fluke.

00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:15.440
Maybe it's something wrong, but.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.608
But your Sunday.

00:31:16.608 --> 00:31:19.444
I wake up this morning,
which reports the day before is numbers.

00:31:19.444 --> 00:31:20.345
I'm just.

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:21.880
I'm. God, I'm not.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.747
I'm not even.

00:31:22.747 --> 00:31:24.082
I'm not even above him.

00:31:24.082 --> 00:31:26.251
Why you take me off the chart?

00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:28.586
No. I feel like
I deserve to be on the chart.

00:31:28.586 --> 00:31:31.456
and so that actually turned
into a lot of backlash and conversation

00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:32.390
from people who thought, you know,

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:35.393
an independent creator was being snubbed
and iced out by the mainstream.

00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:36.828
But also, you had Forbes saying

00:31:36.828 --> 00:31:38.997
that it was likely that it was
maybe some sort of glitch. Right.

00:31:38.997 --> 00:31:40.632
Because Iron Lung is now back
on the charts

00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:43.001
and on Box Office Mojo,
which is the most used chart, it

00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:44.702
apparently never left in the first place.

00:31:44.702 --> 00:31:45.136
last night,

00:31:45.136 --> 00:31:46.905
while it seemed like
it was a neck and neck race

00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:49.007
for the weekend top spot
between the two films,

00:31:49.007 --> 00:31:51.042
he really tried to push people
to keep the momentum up.

00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:53.845
Sam Raimi chasing me up my own ass.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.883
So for.

00:31:59.183 --> 00:32:01.419
So you got some free time tonight?

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:02.820
You want to see Iron Lung?

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:06.724
Tonight
would be the night to make it count.

00:32:07.091 --> 00:32:09.761
And then Disney won't have

00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:13.598
the number one movie
for the 10th week in a row.

00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:15.667
you know, in the end,
sent help beat Ireland

00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:17.302
in both domestic and international sales,

00:32:17.302 --> 00:32:19.404
which Markiplier said, you know,
he kind of knew was coming.

00:32:19.404 --> 00:32:21.572
I milked it a lot.
I said it, it was very funny.

00:32:21.572 --> 00:32:23.808
I knew that Sam Raimi's
movie was going to pass me eventually.

00:32:23.808 --> 00:32:25.576
By the end of the weekend,
but still, you know,

00:32:25.576 --> 00:32:27.845
for tons of reasons,
you could argue that Markiplier

00:32:27.845 --> 00:32:29.480
is still the bigger success story here.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:33.051
I mean, for one, Mark didn't have 20th
Century Studios behind him.

00:32:33.051 --> 00:32:35.186
also two,
when you bring in the international sales,

00:32:35.186 --> 00:32:39.791
he made nearly $22 million on a $3
million budget, which is just crazy.

00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:41.826
and so far, it looks like
the fans are loving it. Right?

00:32:41.826 --> 00:32:44.262
It has an 89%
audience score on Rotten Tomatoes,

00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:47.165
and while some have compared
that to its 50% critic score.

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:48.399
you've had people including Mr.

00:32:48.399 --> 00:32:50.735
Beast himself
noting the sample size is too small.

00:32:50.735 --> 00:32:52.770
And why I think the popcorn score
is a better metric

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:54.439
if you're trying to see
if something is worth watching.

00:32:54.439 --> 00:32:54.939
In my opinion.

00:32:54.939 --> 00:32:56.307
which I'll say, you know,
for what it's worth,

00:32:56.307 --> 00:32:59.344
it isn't unusual for smaller films
to have a more limited pool.

00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:00.912
A critic reviews for a tomato score.

00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:04.015
though I will say with this pop a success,
we should expect more reviews for

00:33:04.015 --> 00:33:07.051
Iron Lung to start rolling in that aren't
listed on Rotten Tomatoes right now.

00:33:07.151 --> 00:33:09.620
now, because this movie is being seen
as such a success story.

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.655
You have outlets like Forbes

00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:13.725
saying this may represent, 
a future of filmmaking where more creators

00:33:13.725 --> 00:33:16.361
dabble in the space
and drag their fanbases along with them.

00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:19.430
also have Mark open that it serves
as a push for indie filmmaking in general,

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:20.999
that it shows
that there is an audience for it

00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:22.934
and even critics, adding,
Hoping that iron lung

00:33:22.934 --> 00:33:24.602
is the final nail
in the coffin of that hole.

00:33:24.602 --> 00:33:27.105
Young people
don't want to go to the movies. Michigan.

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:29.407
If anything, it proves
that next gen audiences

00:33:29.407 --> 00:33:31.509
would rather think of YouTube
as a pipeline for movie

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:33.344
theaters
than a potential replacement for them.

00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:35.046
But that, my friends,
you beautiful bastards, is

00:33:35.046 --> 00:33:37.582
where your Monday Philip DeFranco show
dive into the news is going to end.

00:33:37.582 --> 00:33:39.183
so one remember, grab what you want.

00:33:39.183 --> 00:33:41.019
Why you can over a beautiful bastard.com.

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:42.487
We got a fantastic new drop.

00:33:42.487 --> 00:33:44.222
Nine new designs. two.

00:33:44.222 --> 00:33:47.458
I'll see you right back here tomorrow
for another daily dive into the news.
