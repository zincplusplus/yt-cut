00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.035
so Trump's
war in Minnesota it looks far from over.

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:03.436
But the people that live there,
they just landed

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:05.505
a heavy blow to Trump's
storm troopers. right.

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:07.173
Starting with the fact yesterday
they waved goodbye

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:08.908
to a whole lot of federal troopers.

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:13.713
I have announced, effective immediately,
we will draw down 700 people,

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:17.384
in fact, that today of course, is Trump's
borders are Tom Homan.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.786
And as for the reason
he's pulling those guys out?

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:21.821
I'll let his boss explain.
Did that come from you?

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:25.658
Yes, it did, but it didn't come from me
because I just wanted to do it.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:30.130
We have we are waiting for them to release
prisoners.

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:34.167
Give us the murderers that they're holding
and all of the bad

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:37.804
people drug dealers, all of the bad people
We've gotten a lot of them out.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:41.474
So crime now in Minnesota, crime
now in Minneapolis is down.

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.643
Crime in all cities is down.

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:45.745
now, while it's true
that crime is down nationwide,

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:48.615
it didn't just start plummeting everywhere
that Trump sent his secret police.

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:50.417
for crimes. Actually
been going down for several years now.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.885
And in Minneapolis in particular,

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:54.821
the record is kind of mixed, got certain
things like homicide, burglary,

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:57.557
breaking and entering and destruction
of property declining from last year,

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:59.692
but other violent crimes,
like a song defenses,

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:01.327
sex offenses and motor vehicle theft.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:02.695
They've gone up, Plus,
you also have to consider

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:04.431
the many ways
that the federal surge is impeded.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:08.301
Regular law enforcement by causing civil
unrest, overloading 911 dispatchers

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:10.203
and clogged up the federal courts
and jails.

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:12.972
how even the Minnesota fraud case,
it kicked this whole shitstorm off there.

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:15.475
It's been thrown into disarray
by Trump's chaos regime. Right.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:17.811
Because CBS reports
that the four prosecutors

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:20.013
who were leading it,
they won't be in court at the next trial

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.615
because they've all left
the U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:25.085
you've got sources citing
a number of reasons for their departure,

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.787
including caseload management,
structural issues with the office,

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:28.621
the Trump administration's

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:32.025
influence on the office, and concerns
related to Operation Metro surge.

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.726
so whereas the office at 70 assistant U.S.

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:36.796
attorneys under Biden now under Trump,
it's only got as few as 17.

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:38.565
and so Trump's DOJ,
they've tried to fill the ranks

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:40.166
with prosecutors
from neighboring districts,

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.502
even from Michigan,
as well as from DHS in the military.

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:45.438
But even some of those people, they're not
happy with their new assignments.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:46.706
which is then how you get that lawyer

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:49.109
who told a judge on Tuesday, quote,
this job sucks

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.544
and then asked to be held in contempt
so she could just get some sleep.

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:52.178
But of course, you know that.

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:53.313
The facts be damned. Trump

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:56.549
has still declared victory in Minnesota,
just like he declared victory in DC.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.718
And just like that,
National Guard are still in the capital.

00:01:58.718 --> 00:02:01.454
Some 2300 federal agents will remain
in the Minneapolis area

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:05.024
after these 700 leave, compared to the
measly 80 who were there before December.

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:08.661
also I'll say notably with all this,
when you had NBC's Tom llamas asking

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:11.731
Trump what he learned from Minneapolis,
his answer was ambiguous.

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:15.902
maybe we can use a little bit of a softer
touch, but you still have to be tough.

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:19.272
These are we're dealing
with really hard criminals.

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.541
but you also had Trump seeming
to suggest that going forward,

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:22.842
if mayors or governors don't

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:25.445
want his goons in their state,
he won't actually send them there.

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:29.549
I say they have to ask and they have to
say, please, I don't want to go and force

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.719
ourselves into a city,
even if their numbers are terrible.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.954
which cities are you headed to next?

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:37.524
We have five cities

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:40.894
that we're looking at very strongly,
but we want to be invited.

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:42.162
now, of course, that is Donald Trump.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:43.563
And with Trump has words worth

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.465
about as much as the pumpkin colored
makeup on his skin.

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:47.300
But I will say the shift in tone,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.702
it does match some of the reporting
that we've seen, most notably

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:52.338
about what may be a rift
between him and Stephen Miller. Right.

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:54.307
Because you have white House officials
telling the Wall Street Journal

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:57.410
that Stephen Miller has been an architect
and almost every boundary pushing

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.645
effort in Trump's second term.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.413
The boat strikes in the Caribbean. Miller.

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:02.982
The enlistment of the FBI
and immigration enforcement. Miller.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:05.685
Having the State Department pressure
other countries to accept migrants.

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:06.052
Miller.

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:08.121
The whole policy
of going into democratic cities

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:11.090
and indiscriminately rounding up people
regardless of their criminal records.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.493
Miller,
the target of 3000 arrests per day.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:16.262
The $50,000 bonuses for new recruits,
the raids.

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:17.997
A day laborer responds like Home Depot.

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:19.566
Miller, Miller, Miller.

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:21.601
I mean, according to the Journal,
he personally drafted

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:24.537
or edited every executive order
that the president has signed.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:27.440
ready. Push to invoke the Alien enemies
act to deport people to El Salvador.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.576
He push to invoke the Insurrection
Act in Minneapolis.

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:32.412
And then you have sources claiming he was
the one who actually started the whole.

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:34.847
Rene good is a domestic
terrorist assassin narrative,

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:37.517
even though he blames Border Patrol
for feeding him bad information.

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:39.185
actually,
after the shooting, a senior officials

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:41.888
debated whether to even continue
the crackdown in Minneapolis.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.790
Miller was right there, reportedly arguing

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.259
that Trump should deploy even more agents,
not less.

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:47.627
now, with all that, I'll say one.

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:50.496
In no way does this absolve Donald Trump
from anything.

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:53.233
He's the president. He's the person
who ultimately gets to decide things.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.735
and also with that too,
I'm not even saying that Trump is deeply,

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:58.471
emotionally bothered by the response
to Good or Friday's murders.

00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:00.473
fact, this is what he had to say
to Yamiche about them.

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:03.376
Well, look,
I'm not happy with the two incidents.

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:06.479
It's He was not an angel,
and she was not an angel.

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:08.314
You know,
you look at some tapes from back,

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:11.251
but still, I'm not happy with
what happened there.

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:14.454
But I'm going to always be
with our great people.

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.656
Law enforcement,
You mentioned Renee. Good.

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:19.726
And not out and Alex not being angels.

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:23.162
Do you think any of that justified
what happened to them, though?

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:25.632
No, I it should have not happened.

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:27.700
know, who feels worse about it
than anybody?

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.870
The people of ice you know, with all this,
if we believe the journal sources, Trump

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.274
is aware of how bad the shootings
look, that he is aware of the polling.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.776
and so they say that he's told advisers
that he wasn't comfortable

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.444
with how far Miller
has gone on some fronts,

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:40.747
and that business officials are calling
and complaining to him

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:42.715
about longtime workers
being thrown out of the country.

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:43.816
also, of course, a big thing

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:46.819
that people have been talking about
are a few high profile manosphere bro's

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.322
kind of wincing at the optics
of these immigration policies.

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:51.691
Right with that including most recently,
Andrew Schultz, who we talked about,

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:54.327
though the one that Yamas asked
Trump about was Joe Rogan.

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:55.628
You don't want militarized

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:59.565
people in the streets
just roaming around snatching people up.

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.501
Many of which turn out to actually be U.S.

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:03.936
citizens
that just don't have their papers on them.

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:05.872
Are we really going to be the Gestapo?

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:07.140
Where's your papers?

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.876
What's your response to him? Well, look,
first of all, he's a great guy.

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:12.245
We had a tremendous success
before the election.

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:16.749
I think it was his biggest interview
ever and over 300 million people.

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:18.818
It was very good.
I spoke to him three days ago.

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:21.454
We had a great conversation
just had a good conversation.

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:23.489
I think he's a great guy.
And I think he likes me too.

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:26.526
so you know, not really an actual answer
to the question that was asked.

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:28.795
the actually if anything I'll say
with that answer, it kind of shows

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:31.698
that maybe he's scared of these audiences
turning on him.

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:33.533
because whether Don and Joe,
they're still buddy buddy.

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:35.702
And, 
my belief is that, you know, these guys,

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:38.838
these podcasters, they'll kiss the ring
if that the polling goes the other way.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:41.074
the polling right now,
it does not look good for Trump. Right.

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:43.543
A new Marist survey just came out,
and it is brutal.

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:46.112
had 56% of people disapproving of his job
performance overall,

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:49.916
including 51% who strongly disapprove,
while just 39% approve.

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:51.284
and on immigration specifically. Right.

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:53.419
Which in the election
cycle was his winning issue.

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:54.454
Two thirds of Americans

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:57.657
say Ice has gone too far
and a 11 point increase since last summer.

00:05:57.657 --> 00:06:00.159
but Trump's response to all this. It's
been the same as it's always been.

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:04.230
Well, I don't believe the polls,
for one thing, polls are almost dishonest,

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.166
almost as dishonest
as some of the reporters themselves.

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:09.769
no, with that, I will say, although the
the polls are definitely not fake,

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:11.170
they can be a little misleading

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.206
if you only look at the broad
overall numbers,

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.841
because when you narrow it down
to just Republicans,

00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:16.876
their support, it remains
fucking ironclad.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:19.345
Despite everything that's happened
over the past year, 85% of them

00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:21.981
approve of Trump's
performance in general, and roughly 80%

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:24.150
approve of how he's handled the economy
and foreign policy.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.319
then on things like immigration,
almost three quarters think

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.189
that Ice is doing a good job, and 77%
say that Ice is making Americans safer.

00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:32.125
all of that said, a big key thing is that

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:35.128
Trump has lost support among younger
people, Latinos and independents.

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:37.363
And these are demographics
that helped push him over the line.

00:06:37.363 --> 00:06:38.297
In 2024.

00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:39.532
fact, with every single question

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:42.735
that was asked, their independence aligned
with Democrats, often overwhelmingly.

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:43.369
but then with all that,

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:45.505
to the extent that Donald Trump does
believe these numbers are real,

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:47.407
he he doesn't blame
anything that he's actually done.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:50.476
Instead, he insisted over and over
in this interview that objectively,

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.578
his policies are amazing
and they're perfect.

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:55.815
And if people saw them objectively,
he would be polling at 100%.

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:57.517
So this problem can't be his policies.

00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:59.018
It must be his messaging.

00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:01.087
I think we do a phenomenal job,

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.389
but I don't think
we're good at public relations.

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:05.358
What does that mean? You've said that
a couple of times. Now. What?

00:07:05.358 --> 00:07:05.958
What do you mean by that?

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.593
We don't sell the great job
that we're doing.

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:09.595
We don't do a good public relations job.

00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:11.798
That's why
I'm doing the interview with you today.

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:12.665
We appreciate it.

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:13.699
Help my people.

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.968
You know, PR, public relations, Right.

00:07:15.968 --> 00:07:17.570
Going back to the
the murders of Renee. Good.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.371
Now it's pretty.

00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:19.806
He thinks that's just bad PR.

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:20.640
Two people.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.707
It's bad, I hate it.

00:07:21.707 --> 00:07:23.576
I hate even talking about it.

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:26.646
Two people out of tens of thousands.

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:30.116
Okay, And you get bad publicity.

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:34.187
Nobody talks about all of the murders
that were taken out of our country.

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:39.225
each boat that we knock out,
we save 25,000 American lives.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:42.528
then even on the economy and inflation,
Trump says that's just bad PR to.

00:07:42.528 --> 00:07:44.764
polls on the economy aren't, aren't
they're not great.

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:46.265
They should be great. They should be.

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:49.969
So why aren't they if you believe that
I don't know, I don't Are people's

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:53.306
expectations too high or is
it just too expensive to live in America?

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.441
I just again, don't think we're selling it
properly.

00:07:55.441 --> 00:07:58.110
We've done a great job,
you know, whatever Trump says right now,

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.880
it looks like Americans just aren't buying
whatever the fuck it is he's selling.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.915
and with that,
you should expect that when they and you,

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:05.418
you make yourselves
clear at the ballot box this November,

00:08:05.418 --> 00:08:07.854
it seems very likely
that Trump is going to give those results.

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:10.356
The same label
that he's given the polls fake.

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:11.757
Take a look at Detroit.

00:08:11.757 --> 00:08:14.994
Take a look at Philadelphia,
take a look at Atlanta.

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:18.130
There are some areas
that are unbelievably corrupt.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:23.803
I could give you plenty more to, I say
that we cannot have corrupt elections

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:26.739
if they don't want voter ID,
that means they want to cheat.

00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:31.911
We can't allow cheating in elections
now if we need to put in federal controls

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:35.982
as opposed to state controls,
remember this they're really an agent.

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:37.850
Will you trust the results
of the midterms?

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.952
If Republicans lose control of Congress?

00:08:39.952 --> 00:08:43.189
I will, but if the elections are honest,
but also with it that the possibility

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:44.857
that Republicans lose control of Congress,

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:46.993
it became even more likely
with the Supreme Court

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:50.029
now making a ruling that paves the way
for California's new congressional map

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:52.064
that could give Democrats
five more House seats.

00:08:52.064 --> 00:08:53.065
Because yesterday, the Supreme Court

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:55.468
rejected an emergency appeal
that the California Republican Party

00:08:55.468 --> 00:08:57.737
had filed in an attempt
to block the map from taking effect.

00:08:57.737 --> 00:08:59.739
map that California voters
overwhelmingly approved,

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:02.542
a counter Trump's undemocratic efforts
to make red states redistrict,

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:05.044
to give Republicans more seats,
and it was a map that almost immediately

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:07.246
California Republicans
filed a lawsuit against arguing

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:10.349
that the map was unconstitutional
because the state had engaged in illegal

00:09:10.349 --> 00:09:13.386
racial gerrymandering to redraw lines
that favored Latinos over

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:14.287
other groups of voters.

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:16.522
then last month, you saw a federal court
rejecting the Republicans

00:09:16.522 --> 00:09:18.958
attempt to block the voter
approved map from taking effect.

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.626
judge panel ruling,
and there wasn't enough evidence

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:22.929
to prove Democrats
had drawn the map with racial intent.

00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:24.864
arguing at the ballot
measure was explicitly presented

00:09:24.864 --> 00:09:27.133
to voters as a political gerrymander
designed to flip

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:29.168
five Republican held seats and claiming
that voters

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:31.671
were clearly motivated
by political partizanship, not race.

00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:32.972
and so then after taking that out

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:35.141
with the California GOP
asking the Supreme Court

00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:37.977
to block the lower court's ruling
and reinstate the old congressional maps,

00:09:37.977 --> 00:09:39.779
while the merits of the case
played out effectively

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:41.914
trying to reverse the explicit
will of millions of voters.

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:42.982
you know, the fact that the Supreme Court

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:44.984
has rejected
that appeal is incredibly significant,

00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:47.153
because California is
one of the few blue states

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:48.554
that has redrawn its congressional maps

00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:50.756
in the gerrymandering arms
race that Trump kicked off.

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:53.326
The Virginia state legislature,
they also passed a very similar bill

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:55.795
that would let residents vote
on a ballot initiative to redraw

00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:58.931
congressional maps and give Democrats
a better shot at another four seats.

00:09:58.931 --> 00:09:59.699
last week, what you saw

00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:00.533
is that a federal judge

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:03.803
blocked that map from showing the voters
ruling in favor of a Republican challenge,

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:06.005
alleging that Democrats failed
to follow the correct procedure.

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:07.807
and actually, while the
the fate of that map is in the hands

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:09.842
of the Virginia Supreme Court,
a very different battle

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:12.211
is playing out in Maryland,
which is the only other blue state

00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:13.746
that's weighted into the gerrymandering
battle.

00:10:13.746 --> 00:10:15.281
there, just this week,
you have the state House

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.850
approving a new map that could add
one more blue representative, though

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.453
Democrats in the Senate,
they widely oppose the measure, arguing

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:23.322
that it could backfire and actually end up
costing them another seat.

00:10:23.322 --> 00:10:24.557
then, of course,
with this, it's important.

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:26.459
Remember,
the Republicans are still busy, for

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:29.228
red states have already redrawn their maps
to give Republicans an edge.

00:10:29.228 --> 00:10:30.596
In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis

00:10:30.596 --> 00:10:33.766
just announced that he was kicking off
a similar effort to meet Trump's demands.

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:35.568
then actually
while we're talking about Trump again,

00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:37.536
we should talk about the part
that he's playing in the search

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:39.705
for Nancy Guthrie
in a different piece of news. Right.

00:10:39.705 --> 00:10:42.174
The missing mom of today's show
anchor, Savannah Guthrie.

00:10:42.174 --> 00:10:43.409
Because Savannah is 84 year

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:46.646
old mom went missing from her home
near Tucson, Arizona, five days ago.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:49.115
When the local authorities say
that it looks like she was taken by force.

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:51.283
she was last seen Saturday
night around 9:30 p.m..

00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:52.652
And after she didn't show up at church

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.387
the following morning,
her family called 911.

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:56.222
then when the authorities,
they found Nancy's personal belongings,

00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:58.157
like her car phone
and while it's still at her house,

00:10:58.157 --> 00:11:01.293
as well as there being a trail of blood
outside, they began to suspect foul play.

00:11:01.293 --> 00:11:02.795
especially
because it's believed to be unlikely

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:04.196
that she wandered away on her own.

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:06.232
Nancy
Guthrie reportedly was sharp mentally,

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:08.334
but she had some mobility issues
that left her unable

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:10.202
to walk more than 50 yards on assisted.

00:11:10.202 --> 00:11:11.404
so that's
why you're seeing the local sheriff

00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:13.706
reiterating that this is not a dementia
related incident.

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:16.375
there's still you had search
and rescue teams working all day and night

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:19.111
following Nancy's disappearance
to make sure that this wasn't a case

00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:21.013
of an elderly person
walking off on their own.

00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:22.815
And then you had investigators
canvasing the neighborhood

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:25.117
and asking people in the area
to review doorbell cameras

00:11:25.117 --> 00:11:27.286
and any other possible recordings
or potential sightings.

00:11:27.286 --> 00:11:28.654
all of this leading to the local sheriff's

00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:30.523
office
saying yesterday detectives believe Mrs.

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:33.325
Guthrie was taken against her will,
possibly during the overnight hours.

00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:34.527
but then adding that there is currently

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.262
no evidence
to suggest that this was targeted.

00:11:36.262 --> 00:11:37.496
So the authorities began working

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:40.533
to find out key details
that could lead to Nancy, her kidnaper.

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.300
to things like what

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.136
she was wearing when she was taken,
whether she was put in a vehicle,

00:11:44.136 --> 00:11:45.771
and how many suspects
might have been involved. Right.

00:11:45.771 --> 00:11:48.808
And then yesterday, on the fourth day
after Nancy disappeared, Savannah Guthrie

00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:50.976
shared a video
where she sat alongside her siblings,

00:11:50.976 --> 00:11:54.180
addressing the reports of an unverified
ransom note, as well as pleading

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.550
with her mother's kidnapers to release her
at least prove that she's still alive.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.052
She is 84 years old.

00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:02.788
Her health. Her heart is fragile.

00:12:04.023 --> 00:12:07.026
She lives in constant pain.

00:12:07.626 --> 00:12:09.628
She is without any medicine.

00:12:09.628 --> 00:12:12.064
She needs it to survive.

00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:13.866
She needs it not to suffer.

00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:17.803
We too have heard the reports
about a ransom letter in the media.

00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:20.873
As a family,

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:23.843
we are doing everything that we can.

00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:28.214
We are ready to talk.

00:12:29.281 --> 00:12:33.486
However, we live in a world where voices

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:37.022
and images are easily manipulated.

00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:40.893
We need to know,

00:12:40.893 --> 00:12:43.896
without a doubt that she is alive

00:12:44.864 --> 00:12:46.098
and that you have her.

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:48.000
No. Currently,
there are reportedly no suspects, though

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.703
there was a brief rumor that Nancy's
son in law could have been involved.

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:53.405
But that was then quickly shot down
by the local sheriff's department.

00:12:53.405 --> 00:12:54.473
while you have investigators thinking

00:12:54.473 --> 00:12:56.876
that she is still likely alive
with her health issues,

00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:58.811
we don't know how long
that will remain the case.

00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:01.614
fact even saw that sheriff
saying time is not on our side.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:02.915
And that was already two days ago.

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:06.018
you know, as these days of drug on
and on with no answers, Nancy's

00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:08.254
disappearance, it's
getting more and more national attention.

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:10.723
We even had Trump chiming in yesterday
on Truth Social, saying,

00:13:10.723 --> 00:13:13.092
spoke with Savannah Guthrie
and let her know that I am directing

00:13:13.092 --> 00:13:15.161
all federal law enforcement
to be at the families

00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:17.797
and local law enforcement's
complete disposal immediately.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:20.199
are deploying all resources
to get her mother home safely.

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:23.202
there was also a sentiment
echoed by FBI Director Kash Patel, who,

00:13:23.202 --> 00:13:26.238
according to sources for Axios,
is directing, quote, all resources

00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:29.175
possible to help and is prepared to go
if the situation warrants.

00:13:29.175 --> 00:13:31.143
their their it's important
to know that Arizona officials

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:32.511
are still leading the investigation.

00:13:32.511 --> 00:13:35.014
And the FBI at this point is only playing
a supporting role. Right.

00:13:35.014 --> 00:13:37.483
With Attorney General Pam Bondi,
who has reportedly known Savannah

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:40.286
Guthrie for a very long time, saying
that she's receiving constant updates

00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:42.054
after speaking with Savannah
on the phone yesterday.

00:13:42.054 --> 00:13:44.256
so ultimately at this point
it ends up being kind of a waiting game

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:46.625
to see what happens with the investigators
as they do their job.

00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:48.661
And while we wait for answers,
obviously our our hearts

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.729
and our well wishes go out to Savannah
and her siblings,

00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:53.432
and we hope that her mom's found
and brought home safely.

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:55.601
and then there's more that
we've got to dive into in just a minute.

00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:59.305
But first, let me thank a sponsor and say,
you know, in fact, VPNs are crucial

00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:01.574
when it comes to your cybersecurity,
whether you like it or not.

00:14:01.574 --> 00:14:05.544
yet another great example, a billing
platform recently exposed nearly 180,000

00:14:05.544 --> 00:14:06.879
personal records, names,

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:10.716
emails, phone numbers, even tax IDs
just sitting in an unsecured database.

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:13.452
Great. most of the people affected,
they'll never even know it happened.

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:13.953
that's exactly why

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:17.022
today's sponsor, NordVPN, is something
that I actually use and care about.

00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:21.093
NordVPN encrypts everything you do online,
even when a website, app, or service

00:14:21.093 --> 00:14:22.962
drops up, all your data stays protected.

00:14:22.962 --> 00:14:24.630
it also comes with threat protection,
which blocks

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.933
malicious sites, sketchy downloads,
trackers and scam links before they load.

00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:28.367
right. Nord.

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:31.203
They have a strict no logs policy,
meaning that they don't track, store,

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:33.372
or sell your browsing data.
Your data stays yours.

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:37.476
you know, I rely on NordVPN most on public
WiFi, airports, hotels, coffee shops,

00:14:37.476 --> 00:14:39.712
basically anywhere
one bad router could ruin your week.

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:42.014
it's fast. It's easy to use. It
works. And all my devices.

00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:43.649

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:45.985
it's also risk free with Nord's
30 day money back guarantee.

00:14:45.985 --> 00:14:48.454

remember, it's risk free with Nord's

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:57.429
So scan that QR code
or go to nordvpn.com/bill

00:14:57.429 --> 00:15:00.432
and lock things down
before the next headline drops.

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:03.369
but then diving back into the nil is,
there's two really big things

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:05.471
we need to talk about,
starting with the Washington Post

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:07.973
just announcing
absolutely massive layoffs.

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:08.674
when I say massive,

00:15:08.674 --> 00:15:11.844
I mean like over a third of the post
overall staff's been cut.

00:15:11.844 --> 00:15:15.147
talking more than 300 of the roughly 800
journalists in that newsroom.

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:17.249
even laid off
a reporter who's in the middle of a war

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:19.785
zone, who's in Ukraine
covering the war with Russia.

00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:22.721
because yesterday morning in a newsroom
call, you had executive editor Matt Murray

00:15:22.721 --> 00:15:26.358
announcing alliance, which he described
as a strategic reset that was overdue

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:29.662
in light of what he called difficult
and even disappointing realities, thing.

00:15:29.662 --> 00:15:32.031
The Washington Post has been losing
too much money for too long,

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.832
while
also failing to meet the needs of readers.

00:15:33.832 --> 00:15:35.534
well, they didn't provide the public
with basic information

00:15:35.534 --> 00:15:37.703
about its newsroom subscriptions
or other financial data.

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:40.806
You had Murray saying that the paper
would be making a number of enormous cuts

00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:42.441
and major overhauls
across numerous departments,

00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:44.743
and some functions
will be just shuttered altogether,

00:15:44.743 --> 00:15:46.278
including the entire sports desk.

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:46.512
there

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:47.646
some reporters will stay on

00:15:47.646 --> 00:15:51.150
to write feature stories also similar
the the book section will be shut down

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.586
in the newspaper signature daily news
podcast post reports has been canceled.

00:15:54.586 --> 00:15:57.623
also beyond that, the post international
desk will be shrunk down dramatically.

00:15:57.623 --> 00:16:01.193
And while some foreign bureaus will remain
open, others are shuttering entirely

00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:03.729
With a Cairo bureau chief, for example,
announcing on acts

00:16:03.729 --> 00:16:06.498
that all of the Middle East correspondents
and editors have been laid off.

00:16:06.498 --> 00:16:07.967
but also some of the steepest cuts

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:10.970
were made to the metro desk,
which covers DC, Maryland and Virginia,

00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:13.138
with Murray describing
the move as restructuring, though

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:15.841
you had an anonymous Metro staffer
who lost her job, telling NPR

00:16:15.841 --> 00:16:19.111
that only around a dozen of the 40 people
employed at the desk were in fired.

00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:19.812
and very notably,

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:22.948
we've seen multiple reports that all staff
photographers were cut as well.

00:16:22.948 --> 00:16:24.483
and so with all these changes,
it looks like the post

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.051
could be trying to set itself
up to primarily

00:16:26.051 --> 00:16:29.288
be a federal paper that focuses on the U.S
government and American politics,

00:16:29.288 --> 00:16:31.390
rather than a holistic legacy
media outlet.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.859
now you have multiple former
editor is telling NPR that it looks like

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:36.228
the paper's trying to compete more
with specialized publications

00:16:36.228 --> 00:16:39.031
like Politico and Punchbowl News
instead of The New York Times.

00:16:39.031 --> 00:16:41.400
also I think, a big thing
we have to touch on is while these layoffs

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:45.237
and restructuring, they're absolutely
huge, it's also not entirely unexpected.

00:16:45.237 --> 00:16:46.805
where the paper has been
seriously struggling

00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:48.907
over the last few years,
both culturally and economically.

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:52.177
so, you know, we saw things like in late
2023, Jeff Bezos, who owns the paper,

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:55.347
hired British media executive Will Lewis
is publisher and CEO to help

00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:58.384
the post become more profitable amid
falling audiences and subscriptions.

00:16:58.384 --> 00:17:00.519
but Lewis's tenure
has been plagued with controversies,

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:02.688
and he has consistently been at odds
with his own newsroom,

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:04.390
which he has increasingly
distanced himself

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.425
from avoiding major meetings
and announcements.

00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:07.493
Even the one yesterday.

00:17:07.493 --> 00:17:09.428
you know,
despite a series of experimental changes,

00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:11.964
including a big focus on AI,
Lewis has failed to come up

00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:13.699
with a cohesive strategy
for the paper's future.

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:15.334
And the outlets just continue to struggle.

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:16.301
so over the last two years,

00:17:16.301 --> 00:17:18.003
there have been numerous rounds
of layoffs,

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:18.670
and many staffers

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.840
have taken buyouts that Lewis push,
encouraging employees to take off

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.909
or if they do not feel aligned
with the company's plan.

00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:25.477
is all of that
it already gutted the paper.

00:17:25.477 --> 00:17:29.181
That basis is unfathomable amount of money
once revitalized with the Washington

00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:32.351
Post Guild saying that its workforce
has shrunk by roughly 400 people

00:17:32.351 --> 00:17:33.419
in the last three years.

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:36.055
then, of course, you can forget the moves
that Bezos has made in recent years

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:37.990
that have really alienated
a lot of the audience. Right.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.691
Last year, for example,
he changed the paper's

00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:42.694
once esteemed opinion section
to have a much more conservative tilt.

00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:44.029
and then, of course,
there was his decision

00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:46.999
that killed the paper's planned
endorsement of Kamala Harris in 2024,

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:49.868
which is a move that resulted
in mass cancellations of subscribers.

00:17:49.868 --> 00:17:51.203
and so that's also why you have a lot of
people blaming

00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:53.806
Bezos himself for the layoffs, arguing
that he is literally

00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:57.376
one of the richest men in the world
with an estimated $260 billion.

00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:59.812
And so he could easily prevent this
if he really wanted to.

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:02.448
you know, Bezos, for his part, he's just
remain silent through this whole thing.

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:04.116
has actively refused to respond to letters

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:06.185
from multiple reporting teams
pleading against the cuts.

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:09.555
And he wasn't even on the call announcing
these huge layoffs and historic changes.

00:18:09.555 --> 00:18:12.224
and so that's only prompted
even more outrage now, allegations

00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:15.227
that Bezos is abandoning the post
after driving it into the ground.

00:18:15.227 --> 00:18:16.595
So you have the post
guild saying in a statement

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:19.798
that if Bezos is no longer willing
to invest in the mission that has defined

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:22.401
this paper for generations
and serve the millions of people

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:25.571
who depend on post journalism,
the post deserves a steward that will.

00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:28.807
that was also echoed by former executive
editor Marty Baron, who accused Bezos

00:18:28.807 --> 00:18:31.877
of exacerbating the newspaper's troubles
through ill conceived decisions.

00:18:31.877 --> 00:18:33.445
suggesting that Bezos is pro-Trump.

00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:36.348
Pivot is what drove away readers
and subscribers in the first place.

00:18:36.348 --> 00:18:39.785
Also claiming that the layoffs were just
part of Bezos is sickening effort

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:42.488
to curry favor with Trump
in arguing that these firings

00:18:42.488 --> 00:18:45.724
are just going to backfire and result
in even more cancel subscriptions.

00:18:45.757 --> 00:18:47.092
personally,
I'll say I'm inclined to believe

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:49.628
that a lot of the bad
that we're seeing right now, it's Bezos.

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:50.896
Yeah. He's he's getting on his knees.

00:18:50.896 --> 00:18:52.164
He's breaking out those knee pads.

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:53.732
man, in addition to having companies

00:18:53.732 --> 00:18:56.235
that have government contracts,
which is a huge thing.

00:18:56.235 --> 00:18:59.371
also just released his propaganda piece,
Melania movie that they paid

00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:02.174
tens of millions of dollars for that
many are just calling a bribe.

00:19:02.174 --> 00:19:05.177
within the same week that a third
of his newspaper's journalists were fired.

00:19:05.177 --> 00:19:07.146
Bezos didn't look into his success.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:08.647
He knows what he's doing.

00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:10.115
know,
I think this is all happening at a time

00:19:10.115 --> 00:19:13.152
where it's more important than ever
to invest in trusted sources, in fact

00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:16.288
based reporting, to combat the constant
growing flow of misinformation.

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:17.723
and then actually on the note
of countering

00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:19.258
misinformation, another big piece of news,

00:19:19.258 --> 00:19:21.894
we got to talk about prediction markets
like Kashi and Poly Market.

00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:24.563
They're spreading fake
and misleading news, potentially impacting

00:19:24.563 --> 00:19:27.900
betting markets and also raising
serious concerns about American democracy.

00:19:27.933 --> 00:19:29.468
Because if you're not familiar
prediction markets,

00:19:29.468 --> 00:19:31.737
they allow people to bet
on the outcome of news events.

00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:32.538
so we're talking about everything

00:19:32.538 --> 00:19:35.574
from election results and sports
to when Jesus will come back.

00:19:35.574 --> 00:19:37.709
And exactly how long Caroline Levitt's
press conference,

00:19:37.709 --> 00:19:38.110
the last,

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.345
these markets,
specifically Kashi and Poly Market,

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:43.715
they exploded over the last year or so,
gaining widespread mainstream popularity,

00:19:43.715 --> 00:19:46.084
and they're handling billions of dollars
in weekly trading,

00:19:46.084 --> 00:19:48.053
a part of that enormous success
is because these platforms

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:51.123
have marketed themselves as legitimate,
responsible financial institutions.

00:19:51.123 --> 00:19:53.225
And truth machines driven by hard data.

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:55.060
where they claim that they cut
through the noise of the news,

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.296
providing more accurate information
about the state of the world

00:19:57.296 --> 00:19:59.798
and estimations of future events,
because their data gate

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:01.533
is what ordinary people think will happen.

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:02.201
specifically you

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:04.836
supporters are arguing
that the pooled wisdom of the people

00:20:04.836 --> 00:20:07.706
is a more reliable source
for forecasting than traditional media

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:10.876
polling, commentators and experts,
which carry their own biases.

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:13.612
they also say that people who bet
money are incentivized to filter out

00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:16.748
emotional bias and look for objective data
because they have skin in the game.

00:20:16.748 --> 00:20:18.083
And so the financial stakes here,

00:20:18.083 --> 00:20:21.019
they add a level of accountability
that those other sources lack.

00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:22.854
then you also have many critics
hitting back, arguing

00:20:22.854 --> 00:20:24.056
that there is no reason to think of

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.724
these metrics
are a better predictor of the future.

00:20:25.724 --> 00:20:28.894
saying one, the platforms represent
a very small subset of the public, people

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:31.830
who are willing and wealthy enough
to place bets, also research has shown

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.665
that these sites are dominated
by young men

00:20:33.665 --> 00:20:35.867
who have higher risk appetites
and are prone to gambling.

00:20:35.867 --> 00:20:38.604
as places like Better markets
explains the data from these platforms

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:42.274
don't offer any kind of ultimate truth
because absent inside information,

00:20:42.274 --> 00:20:42.975
the users on

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:46.144
these sites are no more likely to know
whether a candidate will win an election,

00:20:46.144 --> 00:20:48.080
or a team
will win a game than anyone else. Right.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.282
And last, people
using these markets are insider trading,

00:20:50.282 --> 00:20:53.151
which is a very real concern.
But that's also a separate deep dive.

00:20:53.151 --> 00:20:55.354
But they don't have any special knowledge
otherwise.

00:20:55.354 --> 00:20:57.022
so separate
from the concern of insider trading.

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:58.523
We're talking about people
that are making bets off

00:20:58.523 --> 00:21:00.325
of their own information,
which they presumably

00:21:00.325 --> 00:21:02.394
got from the same experts, commentators
and outlets

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:04.229
that prediction market supporters
claim are biased.

00:21:04.229 --> 00:21:05.163
but then also beyond that,

00:21:05.163 --> 00:21:07.566
these markets are incredibly susceptible
to manipulation.

00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:09.935
well-funded person or group,
they could easily make a bet

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:12.170
so big that it skews
the odds of a prediction market.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.439
then they could turn that around
and try to use that shift

00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:17.109
as proof that the event they bet on
is becoming much more likely.

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:19.311
the implications, they're,
they're alarming for a number of reasons,

00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:21.713
but they become especially alarming
when it comes to elections.

00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:22.314
Let's say, for example,

00:21:22.314 --> 00:21:25.984
a bad actor places a huge bet, an election
that artificially sways the odds, don't

00:21:25.984 --> 00:21:27.986
make it look like a certain
candidate has increased support,

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:29.788
or is more likely
to win than their opponent.

00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:32.057
we understand, take that
as a real indication of who's going to win

00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:35.560
an election which these markets say
we should, it creates a bandwagon effect.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.497
very quickly you have even legacy
media outlets reporting about the spike,

00:21:38.497 --> 00:21:41.466
which gives it even more credibility
and creates momentum for that candidate,

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:44.169
which then gives them a higher profile
and attracts more supporters.

00:21:44.169 --> 00:21:45.270
then all of that manipulation,

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.440
it could prompt donors to flock
to a candidate or pull funds from someone.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.542
And it further advances
different campaigns.

00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:52.477
within some voters
deciding to vote a certain way

00:21:52.477 --> 00:21:54.212
because all of a sudden
they want a monetary gain

00:21:54.212 --> 00:21:56.214
and others may be actually
just not even voting

00:21:56.214 --> 00:21:58.283
because it looks like the election's
a foregone conclusion.

00:21:58.283 --> 00:22:00.052
and basically create
a self-fulfilling prophecy

00:22:00.052 --> 00:22:02.821
where a candidate can win an election
just because one person bet

00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:05.023
so big on their victory
that it skewed the odds.

00:22:05.023 --> 00:22:06.758
so more and more,
it looks like these are incredibly

00:22:06.758 --> 00:22:08.260
powerful tools for political influence.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.729
And that's especially true
because you have experts also saying

00:22:10.729 --> 00:22:11.663
that the very structure

00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:14.933
of these markets actively incentivizes
the spread of misinformation.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.602
one, it gives people a motive
to spread unverified claims

00:22:17.602 --> 00:22:19.905
so that they can manipulate the odds
and then directly profit

00:22:19.905 --> 00:22:21.907
from how the markets react
to their manipulation. right.

00:22:21.907 --> 00:22:22.908
Things like shorting a market

00:22:22.908 --> 00:22:25.277
and then spreading negative rumors
to drive prices down.

00:22:25.277 --> 00:22:27.179
that same logic can be applied
to political interference.

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:30.215
A bad actor, either domestic or foreign,
could similarly profit

00:22:30.215 --> 00:22:32.384
from spreading misinformation
by betting against a candidate

00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:33.952
and then attacking them with deepfakes

00:22:33.952 --> 00:22:35.821
or fake news bots to crash their market
odds.

00:22:35.821 --> 00:22:37.956
that becomes especially alarming
given the fact that Kelsey

00:22:37.956 --> 00:22:40.859
and Poly Market have both actively
been spreading false claims

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:43.161
that could influence their own markets
on numerous occasions.

00:22:43.161 --> 00:22:44.563
despite their claim
that prediction markets

00:22:44.563 --> 00:22:46.732
are more reliable,
the news media both platforms,

00:22:46.732 --> 00:22:48.700
have increasingly been
wading into the news waters

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.968
using their social media accounts

00:22:49.968 --> 00:22:53.305
to pump out tons of content,
effectively becoming viral news sources.

00:22:53.305 --> 00:22:55.941
With post, it spread faster
and further than verified, reporting.

00:22:55.941 --> 00:22:57.209
I mean, these accounts have been accused

00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:59.678
of prioritizing engagement
over factual accuracy.

00:22:59.678 --> 00:23:02.948
is you had a recent Axios report
noting these platforms design content

00:23:02.948 --> 00:23:05.617
that sparks outrage,
big reactions and rapid sharing,

00:23:05.617 --> 00:23:07.853
even if that content
turns out to be false or misleading.

00:23:07.853 --> 00:23:10.722
so you have things like a few weeks
ago, Apollo Market randomly claimed on X

00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:14.493
that Jeff Bezos told aspiring
Gen Z entrepreneurs to start at real world

00:23:14.493 --> 00:23:17.763
jobs like McDonald's or Palantir before
starting a business, opposed, by the way,

00:23:17.763 --> 00:23:18.463
that is still up.

00:23:18.463 --> 00:23:20.999
Even though it received a community note
after Bezos issued a statement

00:23:20.999 --> 00:23:23.001
rejecting the advice
and accusing Poly Market of

00:23:23.001 --> 00:23:25.570
just making the quote up, Poly Markets
Twitter account also posted

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.506
and then deleted a false claim
that Trump had deported

00:23:27.506 --> 00:23:29.875
so many people from Minnesota
that the state was going to lose

00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:31.410
a congressional seat after the census.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:34.179
that account also incorrectly reported
that Iran's regime had lost

00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:37.215
control of Tehran during a nationwide
communications blackout, which was a time

00:23:37.215 --> 00:23:40.051
when independent reporting on the protest
was essentially impossible.

00:23:40.051 --> 00:23:42.721
I mean, also amid the chaos over Trump's
Greenland threats call,

00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:44.589
she falsely claimed
that the US and Denmark

00:23:44.589 --> 00:23:46.425
were in technical talks to buy the island.

00:23:46.425 --> 00:23:48.527
right in these platforms,
they've also made the fake news problem

00:23:48.527 --> 00:23:51.696
even worse by giving affiliate badges
to influencers who spread false

00:23:51.696 --> 00:23:52.697
or satirical news.

00:23:52.697 --> 00:23:54.099
again,
these are just some of the examples.

00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:55.967
We've also seen Poly Market
repeatedly targeting

00:23:55.967 --> 00:23:59.004
big MAGA arms, like Zoran Mamdani
and Representative Ilhan Omar

00:23:59.004 --> 00:24:02.374
with what actually was described
as false, misleading or trollish claims.

00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:04.609
that's also a very big thing
because both of these platforms

00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:06.044
have deep ties to Trump world.

00:24:06.044 --> 00:24:07.779
Donald Trump Jr is a paid investor

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:11.583
to Kowski, as well as an investor in
and an unpaid advisor to Poly Market.

00:24:11.616 --> 00:24:13.919
That said,
there is not any direct evidence right now

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:16.321
that Poly Market
or LG is intentionally spreading

00:24:16.321 --> 00:24:18.223
false information
to benefit certain bettors.

00:24:18.223 --> 00:24:20.225
but we are also talking
about a whole market

00:24:20.225 --> 00:24:22.594
with almost zero
oversight, regulation and transparency.

00:24:22.594 --> 00:24:23.261
separate from that,

00:24:23.261 --> 00:24:26.031
the fact that these platforms
have repeatedly spread misinformation

00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:28.834
and kept so much of it
up, it also shows that they are okay

00:24:28.834 --> 00:24:31.536
with fostering an environment
where false information can flourish.

00:24:31.536 --> 00:24:31.837
again.

00:24:31.837 --> 00:24:33.972
That's even when misinformation influences

00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:37.576
prediction markets that these platforms
claim are sources of the ultimate truth.

00:24:37.676 --> 00:24:40.278
but then next up from that
before we get into our final thing today,

00:24:40.278 --> 00:24:43.014
I just want to quickly
give a congratulations to Matthew E,

00:24:43.014 --> 00:24:44.850
is Matt is seat
geeks latest weekly winner, who

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.686
just scored $500
and tickets, is going to go see Lady Gaga.

00:24:47.686 --> 00:24:48.687
for the rest of y'all. That's right.

00:24:48.687 --> 00:24:51.056
Seeking
is still giving away $500 and tickets,

00:24:51.056 --> 00:24:52.824
and you should definitely enter today
if you haven't already.

00:24:52.824 --> 00:24:55.460
mean, you could be the next winner
and snag $500 towards

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.095
your favorite artist,
sporting event or play.

00:24:57.095 --> 00:24:58.930
I mean, there's like over 70,000 events
to choose from,

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.167
and all you got to do is add code DeFranco
to your seat guy profile for a chance.

00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:04.603
The weekly $500 prize.
No purchase necessary.

00:25:04.603 --> 00:25:06.204
then, you know, that fun news aside,

00:25:06.204 --> 00:25:08.006
it brings us to the final thing
we need to talk about today.

00:25:08.006 --> 00:25:10.475
And that is, American boots
are on the ground in Nigeria.

00:25:10.475 --> 00:25:13.745
And that is the same African nation
where Trump has amplified allegations

00:25:13.745 --> 00:25:16.214
of Christian genocide,
which led him to authorize strikes

00:25:16.214 --> 00:25:18.316
against extremists
in the country on Christmas Day.

00:25:18.316 --> 00:25:20.051
that was the United States
is getting even more involved.

00:25:20.051 --> 00:25:22.988
We got to talk about what Trump's getting
wrong about the situation in Nigeria

00:25:22.988 --> 00:25:26.057
and how the country's latest massacre
is just one example of that.

00:25:26.057 --> 00:25:28.593
the really where we need to start
is how we got here in the first place. so.

00:25:28.593 --> 00:25:31.162
One of the biggest things you need to know
is that certain Christian activists,

00:25:31.162 --> 00:25:33.365
they've spent years
pushing for American intervention

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:35.233
in Nigeria,
though I will say more recently,

00:25:35.233 --> 00:25:38.069
American lawmakers and even celebrities,
they've taken up the cause.

00:25:38.069 --> 00:25:39.337
We're going back to Trump's first term.

00:25:39.337 --> 00:25:42.774
You had him designating Nigeria as what's
known as a country of particular concern.

00:25:42.807 --> 00:25:44.009
that's a label meant for countries

00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:45.577
where religious freedoms threaten,
basically

00:25:45.577 --> 00:25:47.245
putting them
on a short list for sanctions.

00:25:47.245 --> 00:25:50.982
But then you had the Biden administration
lifting Nigeria's designation in 2021.

00:25:50.982 --> 00:25:52.918
there you were the State Department's
religious freedom report,

00:25:52.918 --> 00:25:54.419
noting that mass killings in the country

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:57.122
were indiscriminate,
affecting both Christians and Muslims.

00:25:57.122 --> 00:25:57.789
that determination.

00:25:57.789 --> 00:26:00.458
It stayed pretty much the same
for the remainder of Biden's presidency.

00:26:00.458 --> 00:26:02.260
but then you had Trump
returning to the white House,

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.729
and this seemingly provided
those activists with another opening.

00:26:04.729 --> 00:26:05.030
in fact,

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:05.830
you're The New York Times

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:08.033
reporting that two dozen activists
from groups dedicated

00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:10.101
to exposing Christian persecution
around the world,

00:26:10.101 --> 00:26:13.004
they pursued various Trump officials
as well as Republicans in Congress.

00:26:13.004 --> 00:26:13.104
and so.

00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:14.973
In March, for example,
you had a Nigerian bishop

00:26:14.973 --> 00:26:17.976
speaking to the House Subcommittee
on Africa with him telling its members

00:26:17.976 --> 00:26:19.678
that the experience of the Nigerian
Christians

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:23.415
today can be summed up as that of a church
under Islamist extermination.

00:26:23.448 --> 00:26:25.650
And what happened in the country in July,
it seemed like prove

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:28.620
it was one of the most horrific massacres
that the country has seen in years.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.356
attackers shot to death,
hacked to pieces and burnt alive

00:26:31.356 --> 00:26:34.426
at least 100 civilians in a village
in Nigeria's north central region.

00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:35.927
was a mostly Christian village.

00:26:35.927 --> 00:26:38.129
And the the perpetrators,
they were believed to have been bandits,

00:26:38.129 --> 00:26:40.765
belonged to one of the country's
predominantly Muslim ethnic groups.

00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:43.234
so these religious organizations
on Capitol Hill, they shared stories

00:26:43.234 --> 00:26:45.236
about the attack in an effort
to get the lawmakers attention.

00:26:45.236 --> 00:26:47.072
one that really struck a chord with them,
reportedly

00:26:47.072 --> 00:26:49.074
was published by the Free Press,
which is that outlet

00:26:49.074 --> 00:26:50.842
that was founded by media executive
Barry Wise,

00:26:50.842 --> 00:26:53.244
who has more recently
come under repeated fire for changes

00:26:53.244 --> 00:26:55.480
that he's making as the new editor
in chief of CBS news.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.715
in any case, write that article

00:26:56.715 --> 00:26:58.683
it emphasize that Christians
have been killed by Muslims.

00:26:58.683 --> 00:27:01.286
And then it slammed mainstream media
for not paying more attention.

00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:03.421
it also pointed
a figure is given by religious groups

00:27:03.421 --> 00:27:05.123
to argue that violence
specifically targeting

00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:07.325
Nigerian Christians
or their faith is widespread.

00:27:07.325 --> 00:27:09.694
And the issue it quickly picked up
steam on Capitol Hill.

00:27:09.694 --> 00:27:11.563
reverse
had Virginia Representative Riley Moore

00:27:11.563 --> 00:27:13.665
citing the attack
when he introduced a House resolution

00:27:13.665 --> 00:27:16.468
condemning the persecution of Christians
and Muslim majority countries.

00:27:16.468 --> 00:27:18.570
then had Texas Senator Ted Cruz
introducing a measure

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:19.971
calling for sanctions against Nigeria.

00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:20.605
And finally,

00:27:20.605 --> 00:27:21.473
you with these groups actually

00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:24.042
securing a meeting with Trump officials
near the white House in late October,

00:27:24.042 --> 00:27:26.945
it was then only just a couple of days
later, that Trump took to Truth Social

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:27.345
to announce

00:27:27.345 --> 00:27:30.749
that he had officially designated Nigeria
as a country of particular concern.

00:27:30.782 --> 00:27:33.518
he then followed that up by writing,
if the Nigerian government continues

00:27:33.518 --> 00:27:36.688
to allow the killing of Christians,
the USA will immediately stop all aid

00:27:36.688 --> 00:27:39.524
and assistance to Nigeria
and may very well go into the now

00:27:39.524 --> 00:27:43.361
disgraced country, guns blazing, to
completely wipe out the Islamic terrorists

00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:45.096
who are committing
these horrible atrocities.

00:27:45.096 --> 00:27:47.432
then adding, I am hereby
instructing our Department of War

00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:48.933
to prepare for possible action.

00:27:48.933 --> 00:27:51.069
we attack,
it will be fast, vicious and sweet.

00:27:51.069 --> 00:27:53.672
Just like the terrorist thugs attack
our cherished Christians.

00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:55.974
Warning the Nigerian government.
Better move fast.

00:27:55.974 --> 00:27:57.509
from there even had Nicki Minaj posting

00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:59.678
about the issue on social media
with her actually being invited

00:27:59.678 --> 00:28:02.113
to speak about the alleged
Christian persecution in Nigeria,

00:28:02.113 --> 00:28:03.114
the United Nations.

00:28:03.114 --> 00:28:05.984
also had that same bishop testifying
to Congress again, telling the committee.

00:28:05.984 --> 00:28:07.619
church alone cannot stop the killings.

00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:10.822
It requires coordinated political,
military and humanitarian intervention.

00:28:10.822 --> 00:28:14.092
even had dozens of current and retired
NFL players signing an open letter

00:28:14.092 --> 00:28:17.162
calling on Trump to do more to confront
religious persecution in Nigeria.

00:28:17.162 --> 00:28:18.363
right now, in the background, the U.S.

00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:21.599
military began assessing strike options
and conducting intelligence gathering

00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:23.535
surveillance rights over
large parts of the country. right.

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:25.837
And then on Christmas Day,
which was reportedly a deliberate choice

00:28:25.837 --> 00:28:28.206
by Trump, it launched an attack
involving more than a dozen

00:28:28.206 --> 00:28:31.342
Tomahawk cruise missiles on what it said
were Islamic State targets.

00:28:31.342 --> 00:28:34.145
with Trump then writing on Truth Social,
the United States launched a powerful

00:28:34.145 --> 00:28:37.182
and deadly strike against ISIS terrorist
scum in northwest Nigeria

00:28:37.182 --> 00:28:38.817
who have been targeting
and viciously killing

00:28:38.817 --> 00:28:41.820
primarily innocent Christians at levels
not seen for many years

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.921
and even centuries, adding

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:45.623
I have previously warned these terrorists
that if they did not stop

00:28:45.623 --> 00:28:47.625
the slaughtering of Christians,
there would be hell to pay.

00:28:47.625 --> 00:28:50.428
And tonight there was May God bless
our military and Merry Christmas

00:28:50.428 --> 00:28:53.264
to all, including the dead terrorists
of which there will be many more

00:28:53.264 --> 00:28:55.567
if their slaughter of Christians
continues. now without you.

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:57.335
Notably, a spokesperson for Nigeria's

00:28:57.335 --> 00:28:59.304
Ministry of Foreign Affairs
confirming of the strikes

00:28:59.304 --> 00:29:01.239
have been carried out in cooperation
with his government.

00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:04.075
But you also had him adding
terrorist violence in any form,

00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:07.145
whether directed at Christians, Muslims
or other communities, remains

00:29:07.145 --> 00:29:10.415
an affront to Nigeria's values
and to international peace and security.

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:10.515
Right.

00:29:10.515 --> 00:29:11.382
And that is the Nigerian

00:29:11.382 --> 00:29:14.519
government has consistently denied
any systematic persecution of Christians.

00:29:14.519 --> 00:29:16.888
but they've also kind of stopped arguing
with the Trump administration

00:29:16.888 --> 00:29:18.389
while they're under pressure
with the country's

00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:20.592
national security
advisor saying after the strikes,

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:22.727
we are not going
to get bogged down on narratives.

00:29:22.727 --> 00:29:25.897
so we've actually seen tension
subsiding and increased cooperation.

00:29:25.897 --> 00:29:28.733
And so last month, high ranking
American officials went to Nigeria

00:29:28.733 --> 00:29:31.503
to announce increased military cooperation
between the two nations.

00:29:31.503 --> 00:29:32.470
just this week with the U.S.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:34.773
military deploying a small military team
to Nigeria,

00:29:34.773 --> 00:29:37.942
the first acknowledgment of boots
on the ground, with an unnamed former U.S.

00:29:37.942 --> 00:29:39.377
official telling Reuters that the U.S.

00:29:39.377 --> 00:29:41.346
team appear to be heavily
involved in intelligence

00:29:41.346 --> 00:29:43.414
gathering
to help go after terrorist groups.

00:29:43.414 --> 00:29:44.415
but also, you know, a big thing

00:29:44.415 --> 00:29:46.084
is, if they're only trying
to protect Christians,

00:29:46.084 --> 00:29:48.219
they're going to be leaving
a lot of people left to die,

00:29:48.219 --> 00:29:51.122
because there is no real solid evidence
that Christians are being killed

00:29:51.122 --> 00:29:52.957
more frequently
than any other religious group.

00:29:52.957 --> 00:29:55.260
that's really clear
is that a lot of people are being killed.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.661
Nigeria isn't technically at war,

00:29:56.661 --> 00:29:59.664
but more people are killed there
than in many war torn countries

00:29:59.764 --> 00:30:02.734
2025 alone, it's been reported
that more than 12,000 people were killed

00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:04.102
by various violent groups.

00:30:04.102 --> 00:30:06.938
the victims, they include large numbers
of Christians and Muslims,

00:30:06.938 --> 00:30:08.740
and there are many different reasons
for that. Violence.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.376
there's been what's been described
as a jihadist insurgency, mostly

00:30:11.376 --> 00:30:13.878
in the northeast and northwest,
which is where most of the people

00:30:13.878 --> 00:30:15.847
and most of the victims of armed
groups are Muslim.

00:30:15.847 --> 00:30:17.615
but with that,
you have at least two main groups

00:30:17.615 --> 00:30:19.784
operating there that are affiliated
with the Islamic State.

00:30:19.784 --> 00:30:20.585
the northwest, you have

00:30:20.585 --> 00:30:24.255
the Islamic State, West Africa Province,
which is an offshoot of Boko Haram.

00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:26.357
in the northeast,
you have the lesser known Islamic State.

00:30:26.357 --> 00:30:27.358
It's a hell province.

00:30:27.358 --> 00:30:29.327
and then on top of all that,
also in the northwest,

00:30:29.327 --> 00:30:31.496
as well as in north central regions,
you have armed groups

00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:34.065
often described as bandits,
looting and kidnaping for ransom.

00:30:34.065 --> 00:30:36.668
And in the north central region,
you also have a lot more violence

00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:38.536
between predominantly
Christian farming communities

00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:40.438
and mostly Muslim
groups of nomadic herders.

00:30:40.438 --> 00:30:41.940
and you have experts
saying that these clashes

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.142
that are rooted in competition
over land and water,

00:30:44.142 --> 00:30:47.045
but they are exacerbated by religious
and ethnic differences,

00:30:47.045 --> 00:30:49.180
similarly kidnapings
targeting priests, for instance,

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.516
it may seem like an obvious example
of religious targeting,

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:53.218
but you have many analysts reportedly
saying

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:55.920
this is really being more driven by money
than religious hatred.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.488
and it's apparently
because priests are viewed

00:30:57.488 --> 00:31:00.058
as influential figures
whose worshipers or organizations

00:31:00.058 --> 00:31:01.426
can quickly mobilize funds.

00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:02.527
and then ultimately with all this, right,

00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:05.563
data collected by the armed Conflict
Location and Event Data program,

00:31:05.563 --> 00:31:06.631
it shows that there were nearly

00:31:06.631 --> 00:31:09.601
12,000 attacks
against civilians in Nigeria from 2020

00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:10.835
until September of last year.

00:31:10.835 --> 00:31:13.872
and you would 385 of those attacks
resulting in 317 deaths

00:31:13.872 --> 00:31:16.074
being described
as targeted events against Christians,

00:31:16.074 --> 00:31:18.209
where Christian identity of the victim
was a reported factor.

00:31:18.209 --> 00:31:22.347
And you also had 196 attacks,
resulting in 417 deaths similarly

00:31:22.347 --> 00:31:23.948
being described as targeting Muslims.

00:31:23.948 --> 00:31:27.018
then, of course, I have to mention, you
know, this data, it's far from perfect.

00:31:27.018 --> 00:31:30.221
know, stats relied on for advancing
claims of Christian persecution through

00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:31.756
sometimes incredibly dubious, right.

00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:34.459
Ted Cruz and Riley Moore, for example,
they have cited the work of a Nigerian man

00:31:34.459 --> 00:31:38.429
who claims to have documented 125,000
Christian deaths in Nigeria since 2009.

00:31:38.463 --> 00:31:41.599
his reporting, it's often not double
checked, and it's almost entirely based on

00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:44.736
secondary sources such as Christian
interest groups and Google searches.

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:46.571
he also reportedly called for
what would likely be considered

00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:49.173
the ethnic cleansing of a muslim
majority group in the country.

00:31:49.173 --> 00:31:50.875
and then even his own flawed methodology.

00:31:50.875 --> 00:31:53.544
It said that there were at least
60,000 deaths in that same time period.

00:31:53.544 --> 00:31:55.513
Among those
he described as moderate Muslims,

00:31:55.513 --> 00:31:58.750
the most recent violence, it's
only gone to show how it affects everyone.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:58.816
right.

00:31:58.816 --> 00:32:00.385
This last Tuesday, gunmen believed to be

00:32:00.385 --> 00:32:02.220
with one of the Islamic State
affiliated groups.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.690
They killed more than 160 people
in two villages in north central Nigeria.

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:05.924
you know,

00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:07.959
local politicians
saying the attackers had rounded up

00:32:07.959 --> 00:32:09.193
residents, bounded their hands

00:32:09.193 --> 00:32:12.430
behind their backs and killed them,
as well as burned down homes and shops.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:12.764
residents.

00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:14.165
Also telling Reuters that the gunmen were

00:32:14.165 --> 00:32:17.535
jihadis who often preached in the village,
and they demanded that the locals ditch

00:32:17.535 --> 00:32:20.238
their allegiance to the Nigerian state
and switch to Sharia law.

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:23.308
And when the villagers pushed back,
they said that the militants opened fire.

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:23.441
Renee.

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:25.543
At least one Mexican
with more than 200,000 followers

00:32:25.543 --> 00:32:28.680
connected the attack to recent kidnapings
at a Catholic school and churches, saying

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.883
they executed 170 Christians
for refusing Sharia law.

00:32:31.916 --> 00:32:34.585
we've also seen reports
that this was a mostly Muslim community

00:32:34.585 --> 00:32:36.554
with Nigeria's
president saying in a statement,

00:32:36.554 --> 00:32:39.357
it is commendable that community members,
even though Muslims, refuse

00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:42.126
to be conscripted into a belief
that promotes violence over peace.

00:32:42.126 --> 00:32:42.727
but ultimately,

00:32:42.727 --> 00:32:45.730
that is where we are right now
at as a horrifying, horrible situation.

00:32:46.097 --> 00:32:47.632
Something does need to be done.

00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:49.367
but also with that,
I think it's important that people realize

00:32:49.367 --> 00:32:50.501
that it is very complicated.

00:32:50.501 --> 00:32:51.903
And there are a number of people
pushing narratives

00:32:51.903 --> 00:32:55.907
that are not exactly accurate or they're
outright lies depending on who's talking.

00:32:56.341 --> 00:32:59.911
but that, my friends, is where we're going
to end today's Thursday Philip DeFranco

00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:02.847
Thank you so much for being a part
of another daily dive into the news.

00:33:02.847 --> 00:33:05.249
Though I will also say
there is more to watch from here.

00:33:05.249 --> 00:33:06.084
whether that's last night's

00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:08.119
Philip DeFranco
show that you might not have seen or the

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:10.088
the newest crashing out podcast
I put out that,

00:33:10.088 --> 00:33:12.690
YouTube was so awesome
to, suppress this morning.

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:14.692
don't even know
if they'll let me do an on screen link.

00:33:14.692 --> 00:33:17.028
So if it's not there,
I got links in the description.

00:33:17.028 --> 00:33:18.963
But whatever the case may be,
I love your faces.

00:33:18.963 --> 00:33:20.365
And I'll see you
right back here next time.
