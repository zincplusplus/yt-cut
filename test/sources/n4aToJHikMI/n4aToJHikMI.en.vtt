00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:02.669
gotta talk about this new Alex Party video
that dropped that right

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.871
wingers are pointing to
as a way to justify his murder.

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:08.742
Not from the moment where he was killed,
but 11 days earlier, on January 13th.

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.343
Because it was apparently during a protest

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:13.446
just four blocks from the spot
where Rene Good was killed a week prior.

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:16.116
And Eddie's family has confirmed
that it is him in the video.

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.051
that's actually a point
that I need to stress here

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.652
because I've looked online,
there are a lot of people

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:21.988
claiming
and saying that this video is actually AI.

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:25.291
But on top of his family and lawyers
saying that it's him in the video,

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:28.161
the BBC also verified that it's real,
using facial recognition

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.430
and an analysis of his clothing,
facial hair and gait.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.165
And you can even look at yourself
a link to it.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:32.699
There's a video

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.934
that was posted on YouTube
13 days ago from another angle,

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:36.903
then the video being shared
the most online right now

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:38.004
that shows everything play out.

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:40.640
can hear cars honking,
whistles, screaming, and then what?

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.008
Sounds like pretty yelling at agents

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:44.277
at an unmarked vehicle, him
eventually seen spitting on

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:46.312
and then kicking it's tail
light as it's about to move away.

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:47.881
And with the second kick,
you hear it shatter.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.849
which point
a heavily armed agent in tactical gear

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.117
gets out of the car and tackles

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:54.554
pretty to the ground, where several more
agents pile on as well. You.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:01:02.195
May. we then other agents firing tear
gas and pepper balls into the surrounding

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:04.898
crowd who shouting at them,
And then after a brief scuffle, Brady

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:07.033
apparently breaks free from the agents
and then stands there

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:10.003
as they get back into their car and leave
without trying to apprehend him again.

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:11.171
into the process of escaping,

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:14.374
his jacket apparently comes off exposing
what looks like a gun in his waistband.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:16.810
now, with all that, it's not clear
whether this was the same incident,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.813
but you had sources previously telling CNN
that about a week before his death,

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.015
he suffered a broken rib
when a group of federal officers

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:25.351
tackled him while he was protesting
their attempt to detain other individuals.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:27.720
outlet, also citing records
that seem to corroborate the story,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.490
showing that he received medication
consistent with treating a broken rib.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.392
into a quote that, you know, ends up
just kind of being chilling

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:33.927
given what happened to him days later,

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:37.630
a source said that during this earlier
encounter, he thought he was going to die.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.699
now, in the wake of this latest video,
you wrote a lawyer for Brady's

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:42.368
family saying a week before
Alex was gunned down in the street.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:43.970
Despite posing no threat to anyone,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.172
he was violently assaulted
by a group of Ice agents,

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:47.740
and that ain't nothing that happened
a full week

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.909
before could possibly have justified
Alex's killing.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.112
you know, many reactions from independents
and the left.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.848
They were similar, with many saying
that whether or not he kicked the tail

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:55.515
eight, 11 days

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:58.785
earlier, it's completely irrelevant
to his later execution by the state.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:01:59.385
some arguing

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:01.454
that if anything,
this video exonerates him even more

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:02.789
because he never actually appears

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.791
to go for his gun
during this altercation, either.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.759
but then if you look on the right,
you have many feeling like

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.662
this is vindication with, for example,
the likes of Megan Kelly commenting.

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:11.631
Alex Brady was itching
for another confrontation

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:14.767
with Border Patrol, whom he'd been
stalking, harassing and terrorizing.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:17.637
he had been victimizing them.
His felonies are on tape.

00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.906
He was reckless
and it cost him his life mind.

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:22.342
Another poster boy, illegal
loving leftists.

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:26.045
also had regime lover Alex Jones
calling his actions a case of extreme

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:27.714
ice derailment syndrome. adding.

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:29.983
Just imagine
how many other attacks he carried out

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:32.085
there were not caught on tape,
and then you had President

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:35.221
Donald Trump reposting another user's
caption to the video that reads, this

00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:38.291
wasn't some peaceful protester,
he was a domestic terrorist.

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:38.691
it's a yeah,

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:40.860
it looks like after all the backtracking
this week from white House

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.130
officials on their initial statements
about pretty being a terrorist assassin

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.366
looking to massacre
agents was kind of for nothing,

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:47.901
because now they're kind of back here.

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:48.601
with and with all this

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:52.438
one thing that I would add here is
we need to know what agents were involved

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.007
in the first and second incidents.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.808
because if any of the agents
from the first incident

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:58.878
were involved in the second incident,
there might be a conversation

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:00.113
around premeditation.

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:03.349
know, Trump troopers possibly wanting
to get retribution, get some payback.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.584
but who really knows
what's going to happen there.

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:06.386
Because there's not a lot of trust
that whatever's going to come from

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:08.087
the investigation
is going to be aboveboard.

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:08.788
and all the while, you know,

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:11.124
Trump still hasn't
condemned the attack on Ilhan Omar,

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:13.726
nor is he apologize for suggesting
the whole thing was staged.

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.962
Well so speaking on that,
forensic examiners

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:17.463
have now determined
with a high probability

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:20.033
that the liquid in the attacker's
syringe on Ilhan Omar,

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.334
it was apple cider vinegar.

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:23.336
with many thinking that's a an odd choice
though.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:26.506
Others saying he was probably trying
to send a message that you're not safe

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:28.675
anywhere I can get to you
people can get to you.

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:31.678
you know, even if Trump's
moved on from the situation, Omar Hasan,

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:32.245
last night,

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:35.748
she said that every time her name leaves
his mouth, death threats against her,

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:36.616
they skyrocket.

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:39.619
I wouldn't be where I am at today,

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.155
having to pay for security,

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:45.525
having the government
to think about providing me security.

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:50.563
If Donald Trump wasn't in office
and if he wasn't so obsessed with me.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:55.401
And last night, the man that attacked
me was specifically upset

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.439
that Trump's order to deport

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:04.344
Somalis was not yielding enough
deportations of Somalis.

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:09.382
So he wanted to come get the person
he thought was protecting the Somalis.

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:12.318
Well,
we are protected by the constitution.

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:14.020
also, I'll say on the note of Democrats

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.922
in the state today,
you had Democratic Senator

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:19.826
Amy Klobuchar making an appeal for unity,
announcing her run for governor.

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:24.564
These times call for leaders
who can stand up and not be rubber

00:04:24.564 --> 00:04:28.334
stamps of this administration,
but who are also willing

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:32.205
to find common ground
and fix things in our state.

00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:33.773
That's why today

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:38.344
I'm announcing my candidacy
for governor of the state of Minnesota.

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:38.711
and of course,

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:40.713
this is it's coming
after the current governor, Tim Walz,

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:43.883
abandoned his reelection bid amidst
the renewed focus on Medicaid fraud.

00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:44.684
know, kind of by default,

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:46.686
Klobuchar has got to be considered
a serious contender,

00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:48.955
if not the outright favorite
for his office.

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:52.225
Where she's won elections by double digit
margins before she ran for president.

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:54.761
And with over two decades in the Senate,
she's kind of cultivated

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:57.664
an image as a common sense centrist
who loves bipartisanship.

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.632
though you already had a number of people
saying it's hard

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:01.634
not to notice that in the over
four minutes of speaking,

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:03.936
she never mentioned a single specific
policy proposal

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:06.439
besides getting ice out of the state
and rooting out fraud.

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:07.607
so, you know, we're gonna have to wait
to see

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:09.909
if her messaging evolves,
what this looks like.

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.246
And, you know, if the kind of brand
of calm moderation appeals to a Minnesota

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:16.416
that's now reached kind of a boiling point
under the siege of Trump troopers.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:17.350
and actually with that,

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.485
do you remember how I mentioned on Tuesday
that Minnesota's

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:22.555
chief federal judge declared
the court's patience is at an end.

00:05:22.555 --> 00:05:23.022
ready. Ordered.

00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:25.425
Acting Ice Director
Todd Lines to personally appear

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:28.528
in the courtroom on Friday to answer
for his agency's disregard for the law

00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:30.496
unless they release a man
who is still detained,

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:32.565
despite the judge ordering him released
two weeks ago.

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:33.132
well, apparently

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:36.169
they actually finally release the guy,
albeit only after being threatened.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.404
So now that judge is called off
the hearing with lines.

00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:39.539
But he also wrote an

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.376
absolutely scathing note about the agency,
where with them listing 96 court orders

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:46.779
that he says that ice is violated
just since January 1st and then adding

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.781
the extent of ice is
noncompliance is almost

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:52.418
certainly substantially understated,
because the list was hurriedly compiled

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:55.621
by extraordinarily busy judges, in fact,
he goes on to say that Ice

00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:58.691
is likely violated
more court orders in January of 2026

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:02.195
than some federal agencies have violated
in their entire existence, with him

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:06.299
then finishing by pointing out
the obvious ice is not a law unto itself.

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:06.699
with that,

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.836
he warned that if Ice keeps ignoring
court orders, he'll order lines

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:12.004
or other government officials
to appear in his courtroom again.

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:14.674
but also the fact that this judge
has kept his cool for this long,

00:06:14.674 --> 00:06:17.343
it really is a testament,
I'd say maybe at least to his patience.

00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:19.879
because ever since Trump storm
troopers just poured into Minnesota,

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.749
their court docket has been flooded
by hundreds of cases from migrants

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:25.284
who have been detained or citizens
who allege the rights were violated.

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:28.221
as we've heard from local officials,
police have been absolutely overwhelmed

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:32.024
with 911 calls and chaotic unrest on
a daily basis throughout the Twin Cities.

00:06:32.024 --> 00:06:34.594
but also, I say Lyons isn't the only one
getting spanked by a judge,

00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:37.530
because another one that was lit up
was Attorney General Pam Bondi.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.266
and that after she posted photos
on social media of 11 defendants

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:42.034
who are accused of assaulting
immigration agents

00:06:42.034 --> 00:06:44.837
just before a hearing, calling them
rioters and declaring,

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:46.239
I've said it before,
and I'll say it again,

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.774
nothing will stop President Trump

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:49.942
and this Department of Justice
from enforcing the law.

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:51.344
guess as long as the

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:55.214
law isn't releasing the Epstein files,
it's over 40 days now, Pam.

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:57.683
but that said,
when the judge saw that social media post,

00:06:57.683 --> 00:07:00.653
she said that she was deeply disturbed
that Bondi would publicize

00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:02.789
images of people
who are presumed innocent, right.

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:04.190
You had a lawyer for several defendants

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.660
jumping in, pointing out that they don't
get the same courtesy as mask agents.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.060
and also

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.296
and the prosecutors
asking the judge to bar the defendants

00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:12.532
from contacting the federal agents
they allegedly assaulted.

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:15.301
She was like, bro,
we don't even know who those agents are.

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:16.269
You won't reveal them.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.004
how would they even be able
to contact them?

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:19.472
but then also
while you have all this playing out

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:21.441
in Minnesota Democrats
and really anyone else

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.443
who cares about the rule of law
and human decency,

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:27.013
they've been fighting on another front
down in Texas because Liam Ramos, right.

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:27.947
That five year old boy

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:31.284
was allegedly used as bait by Ice agents
to lure his own family out of their home

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.218
in Santa, Texas.

00:07:32.218 --> 00:07:33.586
He is still in detention.

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:35.555
in fact, you
it is school superintendent saying that

00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:37.557
she spoke to his mother on Tuesday
and quote.

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:40.126
unfortunately, Liam's health
is not doing great right now.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.828
he's been ill.
I've been told he has a fever.

00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:44.564
So I'm very, very concerned
about his well-being in that facility.

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:46.065
and Liam's mom also saying to NPR.

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:49.435
Liam is getting sick because the food
they receive is not of good quality.

00:07:49.435 --> 00:07:51.304
He has stomach pain, he's vomiting,

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.406
he has a fever,
and he no longer wants to eat.

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:55.274
it's actually yesterday,
two Democratic lawmakers,

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:57.143
Joaquin Castro and Jasmine Crockett,

00:07:57.143 --> 00:08:00.346
they went to visit Ramos for themselves,
with Castro telling reporters afterwards.

00:08:00.346 --> 00:08:04.183
You can see from the picture that I posted
that he was lying in his father's arms.

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:05.818
His father

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:08.821
said that Liam has been very depressed

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:11.858
He said his father said that
Liam has been sleeping a lot,

00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:16.128
that he's been asking about his family,
his mom and his classmates,

00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:20.766
I told him that we would do everything
that we could to get him out of there.

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:23.269
so it's not like that, you know, going on
and not seeming to slow down.

00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:24.904
Despite
all the events of the past week, it's

00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:28.307
no surprise that Democrats are willing to
shut down the government to rein ice in.

00:08:28.374 --> 00:08:31.644
actually on that note this morning,
we just got closer to a partial shutdown.

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:33.379
But I will say it's still not guaranteed.

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:36.015
because a handful of Republicans
just joined Senate Democrats in voting

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:39.952
against a funding package by 55 to 45
with 60 votes needed to pass it.

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:43.289
the deadline to pass this package to keep
multiple parts of the government afloat.

00:08:43.489 --> 00:08:46.192
It's tomorrow. you know, the negotiations,
they're still ongoing.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.961
There could be a change between now
and then. just as a reminder. Right.

00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:50.296
One of the bills in this package

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:54.400
includes over $60 billion for DHS and $10
billion of that goes to Ice.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.835
you know,
for many obvious reasons, Democrats

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:57.603
just don't want to give Ice more money
right now.

00:08:57.603 --> 00:09:01.140
With Chuck Schumer saying earlier
this week that in the wake of ISIS abuses

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.975
and the administration's recklessness,
Senate

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:06.112
Democrats will not pass the DHS budget
until it is rewritten.

00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:08.114
so some level of overhaul
could be underway.

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:08.548
And in fact,

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:11.183
according to the New York Times,
Schumer and Trump actually worked together

00:09:11.183 --> 00:09:12.919
last night on a deal
that would avoid a shutdown,

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:16.322
sources saying it this potential plan
would split the DHS funding away

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:18.090
from the remaining bills,
funding the government.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:18.591
and that way

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:20.326
those bills
are going to get passed by Friday,

00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:22.862
and they can buy some time
to figure out what to do with DHS,

00:09:22.862 --> 00:09:24.196
Because, well, Democrats,
they're out of power.

00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:25.498
They don't have much power here.

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:28.634
They want to add a slew of restrictions
for Ice, including blocking agents

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:31.704
from wearing masks, mandating
that they wear body cameras, stop random

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:33.806
sweeps, and prevent
any searches without warrants.

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:35.808
with all that today,
you had Trump suggesting that a deal

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:38.911
could actually be on the horizon, saying,
hopefully we won't have a shutdown.

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:40.112
We're working on that right now.

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.781
I think we're getting close
to the Democrats,

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:43.516
I don't believe want to see it either.

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:45.952
Senate Majority Leader
John Thune likewise, saying that he is

00:09:45.952 --> 00:09:48.321
hopeful and has been part
of very constructive discussions.

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:50.523
know, of course, even if the Senate does
figure something out,

00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:52.758
that doesn't mean that a shutdown
would definitely be avoided

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:55.461
Because this new package would need
a bounce back to the house for approval.

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:57.530
And the house is currently in recess
until next week.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.798
so depending on how things play out,

00:09:58.798 --> 00:10:01.033
we could be looking at a partial shutdown
starting this weekend.

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:03.869
But for now, it's really just a waiting
game to see how this plays out.

00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:05.905
and then there's more
we've got to dive into in just a minute.

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:07.740
But first,
let me thank a sponsor and say, you know,

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.609
I realize something
uncomfortable recently.

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:10.309
email inbox.

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:12.278
And it was more about me
than some of my friends do.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.579
every sign up, every receipt,

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:16.749
every just checking in from brands
I never remember giving my email to.

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:17.350
It adds up.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:18.618
that's why I switch to Proton Mail,

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.386
today's sponsor
and why I'm excited to recommend it.

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:23.222
Proton Mail is a free email service
built around privacy and security.

00:10:23.222 --> 00:10:25.558
Not ads, not data mining,
not creepy tracking.

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:26.659
unlike traditional platforms,

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:29.762
proton doesn't scan your emails, sell
your data, or build a profile on you.

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:31.097
Everything's encrypted by default.

00:10:31.097 --> 00:10:33.833
Meaning that your messages are protected
even from proton themselves.

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:35.501
the best part? It still feels simple.

00:10:35.501 --> 00:10:39.205
Clean inbox, smart organization tools,
easy search, no tech degree required.

00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:40.740
switching. It's easier than you'd think.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.341
Just move your old emails over.

00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:43.776
You can start fresh with a new address.

00:10:43.776 --> 00:10:45.277
also, I gotta say, I love that it blocks

00:10:45.277 --> 00:10:49.248
trackers and shady junk automatically,
so my inbox feels quieter, less chaotic.

00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:50.916
know, if you've ever thought
I should probably care

00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:53.219
more about my privacy,
this is the easiest place to start.

00:10:53.219 --> 00:10:55.554
can sign up for ProtonMail for free
right now.

00:10:55.554 --> 00:10:56.822
No catch, no trial clock.

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:57.623
Just better email.

00:10:57.623 --> 00:10:57.823
just had

00:10:57.823 --> 00:11:01.927
a proton that me slash Philip DeFranco
or scan the QR code and get started today.

00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:05.097
It's free right now
at proton dot me slash Philip DeFranco.

00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:06.866
but then getting back into the news.

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:09.969
Trump's FBI raid on an election center
in Fulton County, Georgia.

00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:12.138
It is unlike anything
we've ever seen before.

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:14.340
and among a lot of other things,
this could be a terrifying

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.809
look into what
is to come ahead of the midterms. Right?

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:20.179
That is what numerous experts are saying
right now about the unprecedented actions

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:22.615
taken yesterday in a county
that was at the center of Trump's

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:24.283
false claims about the 2020 election.

00:11:24.283 --> 00:11:26.252
you know, touched on this briefly
and yesterday's show,

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:27.920
but it was breaking as is recording.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.288
So there's a lot we didn't know. ribbit.

00:11:29.288 --> 00:11:31.590
Since then, we've learned some more,
including a bit of information

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.359
about the search warrant
that the FBI executed,

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:35.795
which said that the raid was part
of a criminal investigation

00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:38.197
into possible violations
of two different federal laws.

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:40.966
the first law requires the preservation
of election related materials,

00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:44.136
and the second criminalizes voter
intimidation tactics and makes it illegal

00:11:44.136 --> 00:11:47.406
to submit or tabulate fraudulent voter
registration and ballot information,

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.841
specifically the warrant, authorize

00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:52.211
the FBI to search for all physical ballots
from the 2020 general election.

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:54.180
All images produced during
ballot scanning,

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.849
all voter rolls
from that year, and all tabulator tapes,

00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:59.885
which is basically a receipt for the vote
totals recorded by the voting machines.

00:11:59.885 --> 00:11:59.952
right.

00:11:59.952 --> 00:12:00.820
And so then with all that, you

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.822
at Mo Ivory,
a Democratic commissioner for Fulton

00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:05.891
County, is saying in a post
that the FBI's first warrant had an error.

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:09.128
But once the error was resolved,
FBI agents returned later in the day

00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:11.330
with a second warrant,
and county officials complied, with

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.600
then agents surrounding the facility
with lines of drugs and they spent hours

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.503
ticking away, boxes and boxes
of old ballots and other materials.

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:20.072
but at least for right now, that's
that's basically all we know for sure.

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:21.440
There there haven't been any more details

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.243
about the investigation
or even what the exact allegations are.

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:26.078
you know, with this,
you have many Democratic lawmakers

00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:28.681
and experts speculating
that this is a dramatic escalation

00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:31.684
of the same baseless bullshit that we've
been hearing about for the last six years.

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:34.453
And yet another example of Trump
weaponizing his DOJ

00:12:34.453 --> 00:12:35.755
to do his personal bidding. Right.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:39.325
Three recounts, multiple investigations,
numerous courts and countless state

00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:42.762
and local officials have all debunked
Trump's claims about the fraud in Georgia.

00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:44.630
Trump
of course has refused to shut up about it.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.500
And now that he's in office,
he's using his power to revive the case.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.534
And he's going after Georgia

00:12:48.534 --> 00:12:50.970
by throwing everything at the wall
and seeing what sticks.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.172
I mean, well, shocking.
This isn't completely unexpected.

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:55.775
Back in December, Trump's
DOJ sued Fulton County over

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:57.576
its refusal to turn over the same 2020

00:12:57.576 --> 00:12:59.612
election records
that the FBI seized yesterday.

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:00.246
and that was a request

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:01.947
that officials initially denied,
because they claim

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:04.383
that the records were sealed and couldn't
be produced without a court order.

00:13:04.383 --> 00:13:05.317
then that same month,

00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:08.420
the Trump DOJ also filed a separate
lawsuit against Georgia in an effort

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.024
to obtain voter rolls containing highly
sensitive information like voter's names,

00:13:12.024 --> 00:13:15.795
birthdates, addresses, driver's licenses,
and partial Social Security numbers.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.797
and actually, just last week,
you had a judge tossing that

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:20.032
case, ruling
that it had been filed in the wrong court.

00:13:20.032 --> 00:13:22.568
Though the Trump administration has now
since refiled the suit.

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:24.737
and again, this isn't the most surprising,
because last week

00:13:24.737 --> 00:13:27.506
you had Trump using his speech
at the World Economic Forum in Davos,

00:13:27.506 --> 00:13:29.341
probably
one of the biggest possible platforms

00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:31.644
he could have used to further his election
lies, claiming

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:33.479
that the 2020 election was rigged
and adding.

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:35.648
soon be prosecuted for what they did.

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:38.184
It's probably breaking news,
but it should be.

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:39.451
It's a rigged election.

00:13:39.451 --> 00:13:40.820
Can't have rigged elections.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.822
again,
even with all that, you have many experts

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:45.658
saying that this raid in Fulton County
is entirely unprecedented.

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:46.826
or with experts saying things like, I'm

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.361
not aware of something like this
happening ever before.

00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:52.398
Adding, this just looks like a way
to use the might of the federal government

00:13:52.398 --> 00:13:54.133
to further Trump's voter fraud narratives.

00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:57.403
again, that's something that's been echoed
by many top Georgia officials, including

00:13:57.403 --> 00:14:00.506
Mel Ivory, who said that she and her
colleagues were working on a legal plan

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:03.475
to stop Trump's efforts,
an attempt to take your vote away.

00:14:03.475 --> 00:14:07.680
This is all about November 2026,
about the primary on May 19th

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.348
and then the November election.

00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:12.351
He does not want the midterm elections
to take away his power.

00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:15.254
So he's trying to create chaos.
So this is what he does.

00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:17.723
Chaos
in Minnesota, chaos in Fulton County.

00:14:17.723 --> 00:14:20.659
We are a target.
Protect your vote at all costs.

00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:23.629
I'm telling you, everybody always says
your life depends on it.

00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:25.097
Your life does depend on it.

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:25.531
This time.

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:26.665
also you had ivory saying that

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:29.802
what we saw in Fulton County yesterday,
it's really just the tip of the iceberg,

00:14:29.802 --> 00:14:31.871
We're saying that Fulton County, it's
actually just the blueprint.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:34.173
And Trump is showing us here
what he's capable of

00:14:34.173 --> 00:14:36.141
and what he is willing to do
in other states.

00:14:36.141 --> 00:14:38.244
Fulton County is right now the target.

00:14:38.244 --> 00:14:42.548
The only county right now fighting over
an election that already happened.

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:46.418
But it is coming to a place near you.

00:14:46.418 --> 00:14:51.624
This is the beginning of the chaos of 2026
that is about to ensue.

00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:52.725
you know, she's definitely not alone here.

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:56.061
You also had Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff
issuing a very similar warning.

00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:58.097
this is a seismic event.

00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:02.368
This should have people across the country
absolutely shocked.

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:04.536
This is a huge deal.

00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:09.408
This is an FBI raid
on the Fulton County Elections Office.

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:12.878
His conspiracy theory is about the 2020

00:15:12.878 --> 00:15:15.915
election have been based in Georgia
from the very start.

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:20.219
This is a shot across the bow
at the midterm elections.

00:15:20.886 --> 00:15:25.791
He tried to steal power
when he lost it in 2020.

00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:30.663
We have to be prepared
for all kinds of schemes and shenanigans.

00:15:30.863 --> 00:15:34.934
We have to be prepared for him to try
to deprive people of their voting rights.

00:15:35.034 --> 00:15:36.435
I think it's very important to be 1,000%

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:38.270
clear with you
about what is happening here.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:42.441
This is just a preview of what is to come,
this raid, the the lies that he tells to

00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:45.978
cast doubt on election security,
his red state gerrymandering campaign.

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:49.081
It is just an appetizer
for the main course, served by a chef

00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:50.649
who cooked up a full blown insurrection.

00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:52.184
The last time we sat around
the dinner table.

00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:53.519
the only way you I

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:57.523
we can fight it is to do what Ivory said
and vote like your life depends on it.

00:15:57.523 --> 00:16:00.826
And also, I guess, in the background, hope
that the MAGA civil war divides

00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:03.429
Republicans enough that their voters
just kind of turn on them. Right.

00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:06.465
Actually, speaking of the
the so-called MAGA Civil War, Candace

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:09.568
Owens has now leaked
even more alleged footage of Erica Kirk.

00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:12.438
right in this time,
it's from a zoom call with TPUs, a staff

00:16:12.438 --> 00:16:15.307
that apparently took place
just six days after Charlie was shot.

00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:17.876
you have people now adding this
and comparing this to, you know, yesterday

00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:21.113
we talked about audio that Candace shared
where following Charlie's memorial,

00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:24.049
Erica is boasting about merch sales,
which sounds really happy, you know,

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:26.385
those clips, they face a lot of backlash
from a number of people.

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:29.788
Now, with this zoom call, you Candace,
again, taking issue with Erica's tone

00:16:29.788 --> 00:16:32.725
and how often she uses Charlie
to encourage people to work harder.

00:16:32.725 --> 00:16:33.859
and so. She shares clips like this

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:36.962
where Erica gets emotional
talking about TP, USA future.

00:16:36.962 --> 00:16:40.632
Turning Point
USA will continue like my husband

00:16:40.632 --> 00:16:44.036
always wanted, I'm going to work hard
because that's what he was born,

00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:48.440
I will fight like hell to make sure that
all of you have a job here.

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:50.275
I don't want

00:16:50.275 --> 00:16:53.278
anyone to think the in jeopardy

00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:57.049
because your family,
I think Charlie's just.

00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:03.088
I'm trying not to say that he would be.

00:17:03.088 --> 00:17:05.657
He's obviously celebrating Halloween,

00:17:05.657 --> 00:17:08.727
amongst so many things,
but he's so proud of all of you.

00:17:08.827 --> 00:17:09.495
It's just.

00:17:09.495 --> 00:17:12.598
I feel so blessed and honored.

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:15.934
you know, like with the last clip,
the reaction to it is sort of a mixed bag.

00:17:15.934 --> 00:17:17.536
But here you had Candace thinking.

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:20.906
one. It's, to suggest that Charlie would
be celebrating after being assassinated.

00:17:20.906 --> 00:17:24.309
And two, it's also weird to her to hear
a widow say that she feels blessed.

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.410
Right.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.078
And that is
you've also had a number of people

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:28.180
pointing out this moment
where Erica is kind of smiling

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.616
very big as the zoom call starts. Yep.
There you go.

00:17:30.616 --> 00:17:32.418
Oh, look at all the thumbs up.

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:34.153
Look how cute that is.

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:35.821
Sorry.
This is a little bit more in Berlin.

00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:38.390
Probably
Charlie would be reacting. You know Swedes

00:17:39.625 --> 00:17:39.958
anywhere.

00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.994
They can do that. Thank you to them.

00:17:41.994 --> 00:17:43.128
You know. Really sorry.

00:17:43.128 --> 00:17:46.765
You guys, 
I just wanted to say, first and foremost,

00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:51.470
my heart obviously is broken for
you guys as much it is for our family.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.337
You also in the videos

00:17:52.337 --> 00:17:55.841
we've now seen, Erica encourages people
not to judge people for how they grieve.

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:58.477
be sort with them and one another.
Everyone thinks differently.

00:17:58.477 --> 00:18:01.246
So if someone's acting weird,
don't read into that.

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:02.781
I wish I could help all of you,

00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:07.019
but again, the fact that,
this a lot of the opposition to the fact

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:11.323
that a lot of you guys are here in office
associated with the mission,

00:18:11.323 --> 00:18:14.793
he doesn't want you to just be sitting
on the couch alone in your room.

00:18:14.793 --> 00:18:16.228
so when it Candace's
biggest issues with this

00:18:16.228 --> 00:18:18.230
is that the employees
apparently thought this hustle

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.365
through the tragedy messaging
felt kind of cult like.

00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:23.902
they were only given Erica

00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:27.873
as this symbol of you guys need to work
harder, right?

00:18:28.373 --> 00:18:31.810
As though Charlie's wife was being used
to convince employees that it is now

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:36.448
a mandate handed to them by God
to work harder to sacrifice themselves,

00:18:36.448 --> 00:18:37.549
to work longer days.

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:39.952
Because this this is their new family.

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:41.587
you know, with all this, the reactions
I will say

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:44.089
are a little more split here
than with yesterday's clips. Right?

00:18:44.089 --> 00:18:46.391
You have some people, again,
thinking that Erica doesn't

00:18:46.391 --> 00:18:47.926
sound like a grieving widow, though.

00:18:47.926 --> 00:18:49.628
Others
thinking that, you know, it's not weird

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:51.363
that she's putting on a brave face
and that.

00:18:51.363 --> 00:18:54.466
Yeah, she smiled, but she was just
reacting to her team, supporting her.

00:18:54.466 --> 00:18:54.600
Right.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.702
Arguing that if smiling
while grieving is illegal,

00:18:56.702 --> 00:18:58.904
well, you could also see Candace
smiling on camera

00:18:58.904 --> 00:19:00.472
in the aftermath of Charlie's
death as well.

00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:00.973
all of this is

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:01.807
you have people saying that

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:04.810
when it comes to Candace, it's worth
noting that it's to her direct benefit

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:08.213
to try to get people to turn on Erica
Kirk, especially amid this MAGA civil war.

00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:10.516
people are arguing
that it's about audience consolidation

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:13.118
and pickup
because the less people on DPS side,

00:19:13.118 --> 00:19:15.254
the more people would be on hers,
and vice versa.

00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:16.455
I mean, you've even had the New York Times

00:19:16.455 --> 00:19:19.691
previously saying that this is a story
about conservatives creating a monster

00:19:19.691 --> 00:19:21.560
they can't control, saying,
having elevated her

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.962
in large part for her willingness
to say outrageous things

00:19:23.962 --> 00:19:25.464
about her opponents, people on the right

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:28.567
are now surprised by her willingness
to say outrageous things about them.

00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:30.469
and then we've got to dive into more in
just a minute.

00:19:30.469 --> 00:19:32.271
But first,
let me thank a sponsor and say, you know,

00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:34.940
I thought a lot about what it means
to truly show up for my family.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.642
you know, not just for now,
but for the long term.

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:39.311
Being a parent means protecting my family.
It's a non-negotiable.

today's sponsor fabric. My Gerber life.

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:43.315
It's something I actually think
matters. becoming a parent.

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:45.417
It rewires your brain
that the stakes feel real.

00:19:45.417 --> 00:19:48.287
you know, I put off life insurance
because I assumed it would be expensive

00:19:48.287 --> 00:19:50.722
and annoying and full of paperwork,
but it turns out not true.

00:19:50.722 --> 00:19:53.759

That's m e t fabric. Com slash DeFranco.

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:35.334
then getting back into the news,
Donald Trump is now giving to companies

00:20:35.334 --> 00:20:38.470
with a history of bribery and corruption,
the right to buy Venezuelan oil.

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:41.573
He's holding the money from those sales
and an offshore Qatari bank account.

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:44.776
And he has the final say over
whether all of those funds are given

00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:45.811
to the Venezuelan government. right.

00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:47.813
That is the plan that Secretary of State
Marco Rubio

00:20:47.813 --> 00:20:49.481
had to defend
before the Senate Foreign Relations

00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:51.750
Committee yesterday,
in his first public testimony to Congress

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.752
since the abduction and arrest of Nicolas
Maduro.

00:20:53.752 --> 00:20:55.921
we're we'll start with the two companies
who have been awarded

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:58.290
confidential licenses
to buy and sell Venezuelan

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.426
oil with little independent oversight
despite continued sanctions.

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:03.428
their names are Vitali and Trafigura.

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:06.498
And they're actually two of the three
largest oil trading firms in the world.

00:21:06.498 --> 00:21:06.565
right.

00:21:06.565 --> 00:21:08.000
And they're getting this deal
about one year

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.768
after the Trump administration
absolutely gutted

00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:11.903
the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Unit at the Justice Department.

00:21:11.903 --> 00:21:13.038
it ends up being notable

00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:15.140
because that DOJ unit,
they brought charges

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.710
against these two companies
and their traders in 2020 and 2024,

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.913
In fact, Vito ended up paying $135 million
in criminal penalties

00:21:21.913 --> 00:21:25.117
to settle accusations that it bribed
officials in Mexico, Ecuador and Brazil.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.119
Trafigura,
they ended up forking over fines

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:30.389
and forfeitures totaling $126 million
as part of a plea deal

00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:31.590
in which it admitted guilt.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:34.326
that case specifically involved payments
being funneled through shell companies

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:36.228
and offshore accounts
in order to conceal bribes

00:21:36.228 --> 00:21:37.062
to Brazilian officials

00:21:37.062 --> 00:21:40.432
that the DOJ said netted
the company over $61 million in profits.

00:21:40.432 --> 00:21:42.401
the even that it's kind of
just the tip of the iceberg.

00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:46.138
In 2024, for example, Trafigura
agreed to pay another $55 million

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:47.239
in civil penalties to U.S.

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:48.940
regulators over allegations
that it acquired

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.176
confidential information
about gasoline contracts,

00:21:51.176 --> 00:21:53.612
manipulated prices
and impeded potential whistleblowers.

00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:54.579
a month later, Vitol

00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:57.849
and another firm coughed up a cool
$50 million to deal with a case

00:21:57.849 --> 00:22:00.052
brought by the California
AG involving allegations

00:22:00.052 --> 00:22:01.987
that they had secretly worked together
to tamper

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:03.955
with and manipulate
gasoline prices in the state.

00:22:03.955 --> 00:22:06.992
that another month later, an individual
retail trader was convicted of bribery.

00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:09.594
And last year, Trafigura was convicted
on corruption charges

00:22:09.594 --> 00:22:12.864
in Switzerland for having bribed
Angolan officials for oil contracts.

00:22:12.864 --> 00:22:14.333
Although the company
is now appealing that.

00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:16.268
and so then with all that,
you have people like Robert Bachman,

00:22:16.268 --> 00:22:19.571
an analyst at a Swiss NGO
investigating commodities traders, saying

00:22:19.571 --> 00:22:22.741
Trump is taking advantage of firms
that know how to circumvent regulation.

00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:25.477
saying they were previously hunted down
by the U.S. Department of Justice.

00:22:25.477 --> 00:22:28.180
But that does not seem to matter
to the current administration.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.716
now, that said, there are other reasons
to go with these guys, right?

00:22:30.716 --> 00:22:32.718
You've reportedly had administration
and industry officials

00:22:32.718 --> 00:22:35.754
arguing that their existing networks
of tankers and storage facilities

00:22:35.754 --> 00:22:37.789
across the Caribbean,
it makes them an obvious choice.

00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:40.892
with the head of the Latin American
Energy program at Rice University saying.

00:22:40.892 --> 00:22:43.895
they are probably among the few companies
that can, in short notice, allocate

00:22:43.895 --> 00:22:46.565
such a large number of barrels,
30 million to 40 million.

00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:49.301
So it's a very convenient way
for the administration to solve

00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:51.370
what would have been
a much more complex problem.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.338
with the licenses
that these companies have been awarded,

00:22:53.338 --> 00:22:56.541
reportedly enable them to buy
tens of millions of barrels of oil already

00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:59.644
in Venezuelan reserves, or that is pumped
while sanctions remain in place.

00:22:59.644 --> 00:23:01.380
and in fact,
according to the Washington Post,

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.382
it may even let them trade
other natural resources

00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:06.718
in Venezuela, such as iron ore
and agricultural products, potentially

00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:09.020
making this even more lucrative
than previously believed.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.522
though
as far as the oil, you have administration

00:23:10.522 --> 00:23:12.257
officials stressing that the deal requires

00:23:12.257 --> 00:23:14.393
the firms to sell
at least half to buyers in the U.S,

00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:16.762
while they also say that
the money going to Venezuela

00:23:16.762 --> 00:23:19.698
will be used to stabilize the economy
and benefit the Venezuelan people.

00:23:19.698 --> 00:23:22.834
but again, very notably, Donald Trump
as an individual gets to decide

00:23:22.834 --> 00:23:24.069
where the money is dispersed.

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:25.937
and in this case,
the firms have reportedly already paid

00:23:25.937 --> 00:23:29.341
half $1 billion upfront in Venezuela
so far confirm receipt of the first

00:23:29.341 --> 00:23:33.245
$300 million last week, with the rest
maybe still sitting in a Katari bank.

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:36.081
and this appears to be a way
of keeping the money away from creditors

00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:39.050
with pending claims against Venezuela
and its state owned oil company.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.119
also, of course,
we're talking about potential corruption.

00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:42.521
I mean, you hear guitar and you're like,

00:23:42.521 --> 00:23:45.891
isn't that the country that gifted Trump
a $400 million luxury jet?

00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:48.360
and that's just one thing
among several questionable things.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.829
you know, with all this while
it's a much smaller amount, it's worth

00:23:50.829 --> 00:23:54.566
noting that a senior trader at Tal donated
$6 million to political committee

00:23:54.566 --> 00:23:56.234
supporting Trump's 2024 election.

00:23:56.234 --> 00:23:57.803
though,
there you have the company emphasizing

00:23:57.803 --> 00:24:00.839
that the donations were made
by an individual and not the business.

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:01.373
also, you know,

00:24:01.373 --> 00:24:03.108
I will say,
at least according to one expert,

00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:06.144
the US taking control of another country's
oil sales and routing payments

00:24:06.144 --> 00:24:07.245
to an offshore account.

00:24:07.245 --> 00:24:08.180
It's not without precedent.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.081
where the U.S actually managed
sales of Iraqi

00:24:10.081 --> 00:24:12.083
oil using foreign
bank accounts in the 2000s.

00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:14.252
But notably, you had this expert adding.

00:24:14.252 --> 00:24:17.989
there is also precedent for corruption
scandals popping up around these schemes.

00:24:17.989 --> 00:24:18.757
you know, that's concerning

00:24:18.757 --> 00:24:20.592
not just because of what we've talked
about so far, but,

00:24:20.592 --> 00:24:24.296
you know, the fact that so much about
this, it seems to be shrouded in secrecy.

00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:24.362
right.

00:24:24.362 --> 00:24:26.598
You're seeing things like an economist
who is also a member

00:24:26.598 --> 00:24:30.235
of the Venezuelan opposition, saying
Venezuelans are the owners of the oil.

00:24:30.235 --> 00:24:32.471
And we know nothing.
There is no transparency.

00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:34.406
saying in a normal condition,
a sovereign country

00:24:34.406 --> 00:24:37.609
sells oil, and the exact number of barrels
in the price are known and goes

00:24:37.609 --> 00:24:38.410
to the central bank.

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:40.545
adding again, right now we know nothing.

00:24:40.545 --> 00:24:43.048
so with all of this, just today,
you had California Representative Robert

00:24:43.048 --> 00:24:47.018
Garcia sending a letter to the CEOs
of E-toll and Trafigura asking for answers

00:24:47.018 --> 00:24:49.554
about any agreements made with the Trump
administration in Venezuela.

00:24:49.554 --> 00:24:51.790
you're also seeing Senator
Elizabeth Warren claiming in a statement

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:53.425
that the Trump administration is funneling

00:24:53.425 --> 00:24:55.727
another country's oil revenues
into handpicked accounts

00:24:55.727 --> 00:24:57.696
with virtually no oversight and adding,
Congress

00:24:57.696 --> 00:25:01.132
cannot allow Trump to treat Venezuela's
oil profits like his personal slush fund.

00:25:01.199 --> 00:25:04.469
I, Warren, along with four other senators,
have actually launched an investigation

00:25:04.469 --> 00:25:07.739
asking for information from 15 major
American banks to figure out

00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:09.341
whether they were approached
by the administration

00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:11.042
before the military action
in Venezuela. right.

00:25:11.042 --> 00:25:13.178
Because you've actually had Donald
Trump telling reporters

00:25:13.178 --> 00:25:15.780
straight up that he had spoken
with oil executives before

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.817
and after the military operation
and so yesterday you had Rubio

00:25:18.817 --> 00:25:22.153
trying to do some damage control, denying
that that had ever actually happened.

00:25:22.187 --> 00:25:23.255
That never happened.

00:25:23.255 --> 00:25:25.757
I couldn't be with him
because it never happened.

00:25:25.757 --> 00:25:28.226
The oil executives were not involved
whatsoever

00:25:28.226 --> 00:25:29.895
in any of the planning on this matter.

00:25:29.895 --> 00:25:31.930
all of those executives learned
about this operation.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:32.597
At the same time,

00:25:32.597 --> 00:25:36.101
everybody else did what President Trump
has said the opposite in public.

00:25:36.101 --> 00:25:38.103
but then and getting to
what's actually happening

00:25:38.103 --> 00:25:38.970
now, you had Rubio

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:42.541
trying to clarify a little bit about what
the plan is regarding Venezuelan oil.

00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:42.674
Right.

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:44.342
So we will confirm that the proceeds from

00:25:44.342 --> 00:25:46.378
sales
are held in an offshore account in Qatar.

00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:48.213
But he said that eventually
they'll be transferred

00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:49.881
to an account in the United States
or the US.

00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:51.783
Can block with sanctions if necessary.

00:25:51.783 --> 00:25:54.152
then to get the money in this account,
he explained that Venezuela's

00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:57.355
interim government is agreed to submit
a monthly budget request, meaning

00:25:57.355 --> 00:25:59.324
that it would have to request
the use of those funds

00:25:59.324 --> 00:26:01.593
for a set of very specific purposes
that the U.S

00:26:01.593 --> 00:26:04.262
would basically need to approve, with him
then saying that the U.S

00:26:04.262 --> 00:26:07.465
controls the dispersal of the money,
but not the actual money.

00:26:07.465 --> 00:26:07.599
right now,

00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:08.667
at least according to Rubio,

00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:11.803
the Venezuelan government has pledged
to use a substantial amount of those funds

00:26:11.803 --> 00:26:14.806
to purchase medicine and equipment
directly from the United States.

00:26:14.806 --> 00:26:17.275
then among those who were criticizing
this, you had Democratic Senator

00:26:17.275 --> 00:26:18.076
Brian Schatz,

00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:19.678
who questioned
whether the Trump administration

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:21.980
had the legal authority
to create and manage such an account.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.815
also, you had him complaining
that the administration

00:26:23.815 --> 00:26:25.750
hadn't released
the text of what Rubio said

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.786
was the written agreement
with the Venezuelan government.

00:26:27.786 --> 00:26:30.155
then outside the hearing,
you had Texas Representative Lloyd Doggett

00:26:30.155 --> 00:26:30.889
saying in a statement

00:26:30.889 --> 00:26:33.892
that Rubio's testimony
raised more questions than answers, saying

00:26:33.925 --> 00:26:36.895
he wanted to know why, for example,
the administration had chosen Qatar

00:26:36.895 --> 00:26:38.363
and not a country with much stronger

00:26:38.363 --> 00:26:41.433
banking laws and a history of robust
management of oil revenues.

00:26:41.499 --> 00:26:43.702
also said that
by shielding the money from creditors

00:26:43.702 --> 00:26:45.403
through the use of the Katari account,
the Trump

00:26:45.403 --> 00:26:48.640
administration is unlawfully refusing
to honor debts owed to U.S.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.507
institutions.

00:26:49.507 --> 00:26:52.744
which is also kind of notable because
part of Trump's so-called justification

00:26:52.744 --> 00:26:56.448
for taking Venezuela's oil was that
it was stolen from American companies.

00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:59.050
claim that, you know, we've talked about
before is misleading at best.

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:02.120
But, you know, with all that, the pushback
didn't just come from Democrats.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.889
you also had Rand Paul, for example,
going after Rubio for the attack

00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:07.726
and arrest of Maduro, rejecting Rubio's
repeated characterization

00:27:07.726 --> 00:27:10.629
about American military action
as a law enforcement operation.

00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:15.500
if a foreign country bombed our air
defense missiles, captured and removed

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:20.138
our president and blockaded our country,
would that be considered an act of war?

00:27:20.138 --> 00:27:21.072
We just don't believe that

00:27:21.072 --> 00:27:24.109
this operation comes anywhere
close to the constitutional definition of.

00:27:24.175 --> 00:27:26.611
Would it be an act of war
if someone did it to us?

00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:28.747
Nobody dies. And few casualties.

00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:29.681
They're in and out.

00:27:29.681 --> 00:27:31.883
Boom. It's a perfect military operation.

00:27:31.883 --> 00:27:33.418
Would that be an act of war?

00:27:33.418 --> 00:27:35.453
Of course it would be an act of war.

00:27:35.453 --> 00:27:37.389
I think we're in violation
of both the spirit

00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:39.057
and the law of the Constitution.

00:27:39.057 --> 00:27:45.430
By bombing a capital, blockading a
country, and removing, elected officials.

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:48.833
And we certainly wouldn't tolerate it,
nor would I if someone did it to us.

00:27:48.867 --> 00:27:50.402
now with that, you know,
you had Rubio denying

00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:53.471
that they had removed an elected official
saying that Maduro was illegitimate.

00:27:53.471 --> 00:27:53.638
Right.

00:27:53.638 --> 00:27:56.074
Because Maria Carino Machado,
the opposition leader,

00:27:56.074 --> 00:27:58.443
who was barred from running, person
that was seen as her stand

00:27:58.443 --> 00:28:01.212
in was widely believed to be
the real winner of the last election.

00:28:01.212 --> 00:28:04.482
you know, she's also been in the States
pleading her case to Trump, asking Trump

00:28:04.482 --> 00:28:05.016
to help her

00:28:05.016 --> 00:28:09.054
get back to Venezuela as soon as possible,
giving the man her Nobel Peace Prize.

00:28:09.087 --> 00:28:11.256
actually she met with Rubio
after the hearing this day

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:13.024
and she said, are willing to facilitate

00:28:13.024 --> 00:28:15.927
a genuine transition,
but not a Russian style transition

00:28:15.927 --> 00:28:19.064
where mafias remain in control,
saying Venezuela does not need stability

00:28:19.064 --> 00:28:19.698
from criminals.

00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:21.466
It needs justice, truth and freedom.

00:28:21.466 --> 00:28:25.103
with that, well, Rubio said the end goal
is free and fair democratic elections.

00:28:25.103 --> 00:28:26.438
He didn't give a timeline, plus,

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:28.606
I'll say, at least for now,
it seems like Machado returning

00:28:28.606 --> 00:28:30.842
to Venezuela could disrupt
the White House's plans. There.

00:28:30.842 --> 00:28:32.877
well, you know,
at least for Trump, it's very clear

00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:35.280
this whole thing is about oil
and not democracy. Right.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.081
If you needed more proof.

00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:38.616
While Maduro is facing
charges, including narco terrorism,

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:41.853
questions remain about what kind of ties
his old ally who replaced him.

00:28:41.853 --> 00:28:44.222
Delsey
Rodriguez has the trafficking networks.

00:28:44.222 --> 00:28:47.358
you've got the Associated Press reporting
recently that she's been on the DA's

00:28:47.358 --> 00:28:50.395
radar for years, or suspected involvement
in drug and gold smuggling,

00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:52.564
though no public criminal charges
have ever been filed.

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:52.731
you know,

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:54.899
we have Rubio saying
that the administration had established

00:28:54.899 --> 00:28:57.902
a very respectful and productive line
of communication with Rodriguez

00:28:57.902 --> 00:28:59.003
and saying it's our belief

00:28:59.003 --> 00:29:02.707
that her own self-interest aligns
with advancing our key objectives.

00:29:02.707 --> 00:29:04.709
Rubio
also justified the regime change mission.

00:29:04.709 --> 00:29:08.012
That's not a regime change mission,
saying it's a strategic necessity

00:29:08.012 --> 00:29:10.949
because Venezuela under Maduro
had been a base of operation

00:29:10.949 --> 00:29:13.952
for virtually every competitor, adversary
and enemy in the world.

00:29:13.952 --> 00:29:17.489
with them giving Venezuela's alleged ties
to Iran, Russia and China as examples.

00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:18.890
But notably, Rodriguez

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:21.926
hasn't met the White House's demand
to cut ties with those countries.

00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:24.596
so that's why you, a Democratic senator,
Jeanne Shaheen, saying.

00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:26.831
All the same, people are running
the country.

00:29:26.831 --> 00:29:28.466
Maduro is vice president now.

00:29:28.466 --> 00:29:32.737
The interim president has taken
no steps to diminish Iran,

00:29:32.904 --> 00:29:36.441
China or Russia's
considerable influence in Venezuela.

00:29:37.175 --> 00:29:40.512
One of the reasons
that has been given for the mission,

00:29:41.346 --> 00:29:44.282
her cooperation
appears tactical and temporary,

00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:48.119
and not a real shift in Venezuela's
alignment you know, with that, U.S.

00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:49.854
intelligence reports
have apparently raised doubts

00:29:49.854 --> 00:29:53.491
about whether Rodriguez fully is on board
with American strategy in her country.

00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:55.160
in fact, over the weekend,
you had her saying

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.395
she has had enough of Washington's orders.

00:29:57.395 --> 00:30:00.298
so all of that, it brings up the question
if she doesn't end up being compliant,

00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:02.167
what's the Trump administration
going to do about it?

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:04.169
then responding to a question from Senator
Chris Murphy,

00:30:04.169 --> 00:30:05.870
Rubio made it clear
that they are not ruling out

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:08.273
the possibility of military action
in Venezuela. Again.

00:30:08.273 --> 00:30:11.209
the president never ruled out his options
as commander in chief

00:30:11.209 --> 00:30:13.378
to protect the national interest
of the United States.

00:30:13.378 --> 00:30:15.680
I can tell you right now
with full certainty,

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.683
we are not postured to,
nor do we intend or expect

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:22.120
to have to take any military action
in Venezuela at any time.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.456
The only military presence you will see in
Venezuela is our marine guards

00:30:25.456 --> 00:30:26.658
at an embassy.

00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:27.959
Okay? That is our goal.

00:30:27.959 --> 00:30:29.494
That is our expectation.

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:31.429
And that is what everything
that outlines towards.

00:30:31.429 --> 00:30:35.266
But if you had said if an Iranian drone
factory pops up and threatens our forces

00:30:35.266 --> 00:30:38.169
in the region, the president retains
the option to eliminate that threat.

00:30:38.169 --> 00:30:40.071
I'm and then with that,
you had Murphy asking if the Trump

00:30:40.071 --> 00:30:42.507
administration would get authorization
from Congress this time

00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:44.175
if it took military action in Venezuela.

00:30:44.175 --> 00:30:46.845
there, there, you had Rubio responding
by claiming that under federal law,

00:30:46.845 --> 00:30:49.848
any military action
lasting longer than 60 days would require

00:30:49.848 --> 00:30:51.049
congressional authorization.

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:52.383
Basically leaving the door open

00:30:52.383 --> 00:30:54.419
for another operation of the sort
we've already seen.

00:30:54.419 --> 00:30:56.387
but that my friends.
You beautiful bastards.

00:30:56.387 --> 00:30:57.822
What your Thursday, Philip DeFranco show

00:30:57.822 --> 00:30:59.724
daily dive into
the news is going to end. one.

00:30:59.724 --> 00:31:01.826
I'll see you right back here tomorrow
or Monday,

00:31:01.826 --> 00:31:04.262
depending on how a number of things
shake out. until you got more.

00:31:04.262 --> 00:31:07.498
You can watch right now right here,
including my brand new podcast,

00:31:07.498 --> 00:31:09.167
