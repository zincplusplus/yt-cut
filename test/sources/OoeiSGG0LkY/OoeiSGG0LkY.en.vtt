00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.034
Donald Trump told everyone he

00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:03.203
told you to just move on
from the Epstein vibes, right?

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.605
There's nothing to see there.
Why are you being crazy?

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:06.740
But we haven't moved on.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.042
And oh man, is there
definitely something to see there.

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.910
I just wanted to ask you,
have you had a chance to review

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.980
any of the unredacted files
over at the DOJ?

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.681
The Epstein files?

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.050
I did, you did? Yeah,
I just came from there.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.084
What can you tell us?

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:19.519
There's a bunch of sick fucks, right.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.488
So in big news
this week, lawmakers got access

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:23.656
to a handful of secure terminals
in the Department of Justice

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:25.825
where they can examine the Epstein files
totally unredacted.

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.794
Or at least they're supposed
to be totally unredacted.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.362
then when Roxana and Thomas Massey,

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.498
they came out of there yesterday,
they revealed this.

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:34.934
There's
big black screens of complete redactions.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:36.603
And you go in there
and look on the computer.

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:40.774
Sometimes you lift off the black ink
and there's whiting redacting files.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.410
I'd say 70 to 80% of them were redacted.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.147
They made 302 statements where survivors,

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:50.216
talked about who raped them.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.252
All of that was still redacted.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:55.321
And so when we asked the people
in the room who weren't responsible

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.523
for the redactions,

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:59.659
they said, oh, we think those are
how the files were given to us.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:00.927
So they think that Trump's FBI

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:04.130
scrubbed the files way back in March
and then gave them to the DOJ attorneys,

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.733
who prepared them for release in November,
December and January.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.335
the Epstein Transparency Act, it doesn't
just single out those attorneys.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:10.303
It is very clear

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:13.506
that the FBI, as well, is responsible
for making all of these files available.

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:15.241
So legally, there's no excuse for this.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.477
then as far as the documents
that were actually unredacted

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:19.612
for the lawmakers,
a lot of them apparently included stuff

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:22.615
that shouldn't have been redacted
for the public. As Jamie Raskin explained.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:27.854
I saw the names of lots of people
who were redacted for mysterious or

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:31.858
provable reasons, so, for example,
you had people like Leslie Wexner,

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:34.861
the billionaire Victoria's Secret tycoon
whose close relationship to Epstein

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:35.628
is well known.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:39.732
Wexner, his name was, redacted from,

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:43.203
government documents.

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:45.238
And I couldn't understand
the logic of that.

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:46.706
He was not a victim,

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:47.874
Raskin also talked about an email

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:50.043
that Epstein received from his lawyers,
summing up a conversation

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:52.445
they had with Trump's lawyers
about the 2009 period.

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.714
Epstein's lawyers,

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:59.519
synopses and quoted Trump is saying that,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.724
that Jeffrey Epstein was not a member
of his club at Mar a Lago,

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.928
but he was a guest at Mar a Lago
and he had never been asked to leave.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:14.868
And that was redacted for some
indeterminate, inscrutable reason.

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:14.901
Right.

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:16.970
And Representative
Rebecca Boland actually told Drop site

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.905
knew something similar
about a document that she read.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:21.741
One was related to whether or not Trump

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:25.145
the, you know, had ever

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:28.148
kicked, Epstein out of,

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:30.350
Mar-A-Lago, as he claimed.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.784
What do you think?

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:34.120
That is not it's not true
a lie. It's a lie.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.420
easily.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.089
The revelation that made
the biggest splash here

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:39.926
is that, according to Massey and Connor,
the DOJ tried to cover up several men.

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:43.897
the names of at least six men
that have been redacted that are likely,

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:47.867
incriminated by their inclusion
in these files. one.

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:49.636
It's pretty high up
in a foreign government.

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:52.272
And, and and some are there,

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:55.708
one of the others is a pretty prominent, 
individual.

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.944
then actually today
kind of got up on the House floor

00:02:57.944 --> 00:02:59.012
and announced who they were.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:02.916
These men are Salvatore Navarra, Zarrab.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:07.987
Michaelides,
Leah pig, Leonore, Nicola computer

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:12.125
Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, CEO

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:17.230
of Dubai Ports World,
and billionaire businessman Leslie Wexner,

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:21.267
who was labeled as a coconspirator
by the FBI.

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:22.569
meanwhile, you had Massey and Deputy

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.639
AG Todd Blanch getting into a huge brawl
on AKS over these and other redactions.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.507
Or with Massey pointing to the

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:31.344
FBI's list of potential coconspirators
drafted soon after Epstein's death in 2019

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:35.381
and asking why a well known retired
CEO is redacted to which Blanch replied.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:38.284
we have just unredacted
Les Wexner, his name from this document,

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:41.087
but his name already appears in the files
thousands of times.

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:43.289
DOJ is hiding nothing.
then you had Massey being, like.

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:45.925
Except this specific document contradicts
Kash Patel's

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:49.195
testimony that the FBI had no evidence
of other sex traffickers.

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:49.262
Right.

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:52.232
And then as far as the next slide,
he pointed to a list of 20 individuals

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:56.903
and said four of the 18 redacted names on
this document are men born before 1970.

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:57.837
then shortly after that,

00:03:57.837 --> 00:03:59.138
the DOJ unredacted

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:02.208
16 of those names of their photos
were still redacted, with Bland's

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:05.378
writing in his defense, the document
you cite has numerous victim names.

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:08.181
have just unredacted
all non victim names from this document.

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:10.283
The DOJ is committed to transparency.

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:11.484
then Massey shot back here.

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:15.021
DOJ acts as if they were justified
in redacting the men's names simply

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:16.956
because the document contains victims
names.

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:18.958
Tonight,
they learned you can redact victim names

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.294
while still publishing the other names.
As per our law.

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:23.363
then lastly,
they tore out a few types of each other's

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:24.631
hair over this email that Epstein

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:27.700
sent to someone in 2009 reading,
I loved the torture video.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.036
with Massey calling out the DOJ
for redacting the recipient's

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:32.372
email address and adding
that it appears to be assaulting,

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:33.640
which Blanch then replied.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.774
The law requires redactions

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:37.910
for personally identifiable information,
including if in an email address

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.812
you know that the Sultan's name
is available

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:42.915
unredacted in the files,
be honest and stop grandstanding.

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:43.082
which.

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:46.552
And Marcy said our law requires
victims information

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:50.223
to be redacted, not information of men
who sent Epstein torture porn.

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:52.058
also write the the sultan in question here

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:54.093
is one of the six men
that Connor named earlier. Right.

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:57.997
He's the chairman and CEO of a major
global logistics firm based in the UAE.

00:04:57.997 --> 00:04:58.898
you know, also, like,

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:02.368
with all of this, it's coming from
just one day of a few lawmakers

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:04.904
spending a couple of hours
looking through the files, many of which

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:07.473
they still couldn't even fully read
because they weren't unredacted.

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:08.708
so you can just, you know, imagine

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:10.043
how much more
we're going to be hearing about it.

00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:12.178
But as Raskin noted,
at their current rate,

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:13.913
just likely no way in hell
that they're going to be able

00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:14.213
to get through

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:17.517
all the redactions before Pam Bondi
testifies in front of Congress tomorrow.

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:20.687
every member of Congress
who voted for the discharge petition,

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:23.690
if all 217 of us spent

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.160
every waking hour over
at the Department of Justice,

00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:31.230
it would still take us months
to get through all of those documents.

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:34.400
And there are only four computers
also don't forget there are still

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.737
some 2.5 million documents
the DOJ hasn't released yet.

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:38.738
By its own admission.

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:40.740
then also apparently there are documents

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.109
they did release,
but which have since gone missing.

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:47.013
Some of these files have been taken down
like the DOJ produced them,

00:05:47.313 --> 00:05:48.981
and for some reason they took them down.

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:49.982
Maybe they decided

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:53.686
that victims names were in there
and that they needed further redactions.

00:05:53.986 --> 00:05:57.690
But those documents not only haven't been
put back up on the site

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:02.061
with the appropriate redactions,
they were not available to us to search.

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:03.162
As far as I could tell.

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:06.566
We couldn't search the documents
that had been taken off the internet.

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:08.835
meanwhile, you've got the fallout
from all of this, continuing

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:10.970
with people
also pointing out that elites in Europe,

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.739
they're being toppled
by these revelations by,

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:15.675
you know, Trump's own commerce secretary,
never mind Trump himself.

00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:16.576
They're still standing.

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:20.747
You have in England, the king now

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:24.984
calling for an investigation and possible
prosecution of his own brother.

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:31.090
You have in Norway the princess
who no longer has support to be the Queen.

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:35.895
And yet, in the United States of America,
we have someone in the cabinet.

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:39.732
Howard let Nick,
who is all over these Epstein files,

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:44.737
who allegedly had business with Epstein
after he was convicted of pedophilia.

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:46.706
And he still is in the cabinet.

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:49.208
also, you've got a lot of people talking
about how the CEO of chapel owns

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:49.909
talent agency,

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:53.813
Casey Wasserman, exchanged flirty emails
with Glenn Maxwell back in 2003.

00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:54.580
were you at, Maxwell?

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.283
Offering to give a massage
that would, quote, drive a man wild.

00:06:57.283 --> 00:06:58.851
And Wasserman telling her elsewhere.

00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:00.119
I think of you all the time.

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:02.722
So what do I have to do to see you
in a tight leather outfit?

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:03.356
while you had Wasserman

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:06.526
apologizing for his association
with her, saying it was two decades ago,

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:09.595
before any of her crimes
had become public knowledge for her own,

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:11.831
that appeared to not cut it with her
announcing on Instagram

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:14.333
that she is cutting ties
with the agency and explaining, hold

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:17.403
my teams to the highest standards
and have a duty to protect them as well.

00:07:17.403 --> 00:07:19.038
No artist, agent or employee

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:21.607
should be expected to defend
or overlook actions that conflict

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:24.977
so deeply with our own moral
values, saying, I have deep respect

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:28.314
and appreciation for the agents and staff
who work tirelessly for their artists.

00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:29.749
And I refuse to stand by.

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:31.350
at least for now,
you have tons of other artists

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.054
appearing to be with the agency, including
Kendrick Lamar, Coldplay, Joni Mitchell,

00:07:35.054 --> 00:07:38.491
Lorde, Tyler, the Creator, Adam Sandler,
Brad Pitt, and many, many others.

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:41.594
all of that is also happening is
Wasserman is the chairman of the 2028

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:42.628
Los Angeles Olympics.

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:44.897
And so you have many demanding
that he resigned from that as well. Right.

00:07:44.897 --> 00:07:48.267
And then also at the same time, if you,
if we look to the, to the right wing,

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.403
there's been a lot of scrutiny
on Steve Bannon right now.

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:51.204
with the likes of Elon

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:54.207
Musk, Dinesh D'Souza and Roger Stone
blasting him for his weird

00:07:54.207 --> 00:07:57.410
conspiratorial conversations with Epstein,
with Musk calling Bannon evil,

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.180
even though Musk himself had
some will call it, concerning messages

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.249
with Epstein of his own,
exposing the latest dump.

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:05.785
then actually what we're talking about,
Bannon we got to talk about how the DOJ is

00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:08.821
now trying to dismiss its own long running
criminal case against him.

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:09.889
but it's just the latest of the Trump

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:12.558
DOJ is unprecedented
bid to benefit Trump allies.

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:15.495
because back in 2022, a jury convicted
Bannon of contempt of Congress.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.197
And those charges were brought by the DOJ
for defying as if he ended up

00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:20.466
sit for a deposition
and provide documents to the committee

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:22.268
investigating the January 6th
insurrection.

00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:24.604
and Bannon ultimately served a four month
sentence in federal prison

00:08:24.604 --> 00:08:26.606
after an appeals court
also upheld his conviction.

00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:29.075
but then last fall, you had Bannon
appealing the ruling to the Supreme Court,

00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:30.810
even though he had already served
a sentence, claiming

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.879
that he was actually protected
by executive privilege

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:35.448
and that his lawyers had told him
just not to comply with the subpoena.

00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:37.717
and now the Trump DOJ,
which brought this whole case

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:39.185
against him in the first place
under Biden,

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.521
is asking the High Court to toss it out
entirely.

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:45.258
with Solicitor General John Sauer, who's
also a former Trump lawyer, arguing

00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:49.161
in a filing that the DOJ changed its mind
and now believes that, quote, dismissal

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:51.597
of this criminal case
is in the interests of justice,

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:53.065
claiming that the move was necessary

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:56.502
to undo the prior administration's
weaponization of the justice system,

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:59.105
specifically you had Sauer
asking the Supreme Court to send the case

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:01.974
back to a Trump appointed district judge
so that it can be dismissed.

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:03.409
with also Jeanine Pirro, the U.S.

00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:06.412
attorney for DC, being a separate filing
directly asking the lower court

00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:07.647
to officially dismiss the case.

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:09.782
so that's also significant
because if the judge grants

00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:10.550
Pirro's request,

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.853
it would likely erase Bannon's conviction
and his appeal at the Supreme Court.

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:15.187
now, with all this,
a big thing is, you know,

00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:18.791
if the DOJ is successful in this reversal,
the the move would largely be symbolic

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:20.760
because Bannon has literally already
served his time.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.430
but still you experts saying it is just
another unprecedented example of Trump

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.833
weaponizing the DOJ to boost his allies
and go after his perceived enemies.

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:31.270
but also just because this feels crazy,
it shouldn't come as a surprise.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.807
mean, in addition to Trump himself
pardoning Jan six rioters, his DOJ

00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:37.577
also recently said that it would stop
defending a similar conviction

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.046
made under Biden against trade adviser
Peter Navarro,

00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:41.881
who was also convicted
with contempt of Congress

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:43.916
for defying a subpoena
from the Jan six committee.

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:45.918
then there's more we're going to dive into
in just a minute.

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:47.420
But first,
let me thank the sponsor and say,

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.689
you know, this year's
energy is winning a home cooked meal

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:51.857
without turning dinner
into a full personality test.

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:53.092
At 6:47 p.m..

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:55.428
that's why today's sponsor,
HelloFresh stays in my rotation.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.663
It brings back
the joy of cooking without the chaos.

00:09:57.663 --> 00:09:59.732
Everything shows up,
portioned, planned and ready to go.

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:01.434
So dinner feels like a decision,
not a debate.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:03.235
also, HelloFresh has over 100 recipes

00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:05.338
every week, from comfort
food to global dishes.

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:06.706
And yes, the portions are legit.

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:09.275
Nobody's leaving the table hungry.
I like that it works for real life.

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:12.378
Quick weeknights, feeding multiple people
or just wanting something that tastes

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:13.279
like effort was involved.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.615
if you're trying to eat better,
they've got 35 plus high protein

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:18.684
recipes, including Mediterranean
and lifestyle friendly options.

00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:19.719
ingredients are also solid,

00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:23.222
sustainably sourced seafood, 100%
antibiotic and hormone free chicken.

00:10:23.222 --> 00:10:26.492
they don't cheap out steak seafood
and triple the seafood options at no extra

00:10:26.492 --> 00:10:26.892
cost.

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:29.829
seasonal produce rotates in so meals
actually feel fresh.

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:32.064
It's the rare meal kit
that actually makes cooking feel

00:10:32.064 --> 00:10:34.300
rewarding instead of, like,
another chore on the list.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.836
I use it, and honestly,
I think you should do it tastes great.

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:39.105
And it makes the illusion
that you've got kitchen skills.

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:43.142

New subscribers only. Varies by plan.

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:53.352
then diving right back into the news,

00:10:53.352 --> 00:10:54.954
we've got to talk about
how judges are getting fed up

00:10:54.954 --> 00:10:57.423
with Trump's escalating
immigration crackdown, to the point

00:10:57.423 --> 00:10:59.692
even threatening sanctions
and contempt charges.

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:03.162
the Trump administration has been skirting
by or outright ignoring judges rulings

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:05.598
in regards to their immigration roundups
for a while now.

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:08.601
you've seen many of these judges getting
pissed about it with, for example, U.S.

00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:10.903
District Judge
Michael Davis saying in a recent order,

00:11:10.903 --> 00:11:12.772
there's been an undeniable move
by the government

00:11:12.772 --> 00:11:15.341
in the past month to defy court orders,
or at least it

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.009
stretch the legal process to the breaking

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:20.146
point in an attempt to deny non-citizens
their due process rights.

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:23.249
sometimes it's looking like ice raising
detained immigrants across state lines

00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:24.984
in order to thwart judicial proceedings.

00:11:24.984 --> 00:11:27.520
because when ice quickly rushes
their detainees out of state,

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.988
it makes it that much harder for those

00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:31.457
who were detained to file lawsuits
or even hire a lawyer.

00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:33.259
and Team Trump,
they've repeatedly been accused of

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:36.095
using those transfers
to minimize habeas corpus petitions.

00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:37.596
Which is the legal rights of due process

00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:39.498
that allows people
to challenge government detention.

00:11:39.498 --> 00:11:42.068
And with this, you had one
federal judge in Minnesota saying

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:44.670
these practices are deeply concerning
and generally suggest

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.473
that Ice is attempting
to hide the location of detainees.

00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:49.375
you also wrote another,
calling it an effort to, quote,

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:50.743
frustrate judicial review.

00:11:50.743 --> 00:11:54.146
And there's also ice dragging their feet
to let immigrants actually go home

00:11:54.146 --> 00:11:57.216
after the release has been expressly
ordered, sometimes for weeks at a time.

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:57.316
right.

00:11:57.316 --> 00:12:00.386
And with that, you had a Minnesota judge
saying detention without lawful authority

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:03.689
is not just a technical defect,
it is a constitutional injury

00:12:03.689 --> 00:12:06.726
that unfairly falls on the heads of those
who have done nothing

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:09.729
wrong to justify saying
the individuals affected are people.

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:13.332
The overwhelming majority of the 100
seen by this court have been found to be

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:16.602
lawfully present as of now, in the country
they live in their community.

00:12:16.602 --> 00:12:18.370
Some are separated from their families.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.372
and then on top of all that,
the immigration court system

00:12:20.372 --> 00:12:21.574
is under serious strain.

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:24.443
Thousands of immigrants, they've been
filing habeas corpus petitions.

00:12:24.443 --> 00:12:27.513
Are you at a Minnesota court
seeing 400 cases in January alone?

00:12:27.546 --> 00:12:29.882
you also had another judge in New York
saying back in December

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:31.917
that the district had been flooded
with petitions for relief

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:35.321
from immigrants who were locked up
despite posing no danger or flight risk.

00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:36.856
and this overwhelming problem
in immigration court.

00:12:36.856 --> 00:12:39.959
It's not going anywhere anytime soon,
especially with this new federal appeals

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:42.895
court ruling allowing the administration
to move forward, ending deportation

00:12:42.895 --> 00:12:46.465
protections for more than 60,000 migrants
from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua.

00:12:46.465 --> 00:12:48.234
and in addition to all that, it's
looking like Trump is planning

00:12:48.234 --> 00:12:50.469
on further
taking advantage of the immigration courts

00:12:50.469 --> 00:12:53.439
being stretched to the point of breaking
to target specific groups. Right.

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:56.041
And so dozens of asylum cases
where Somali migrants have been

00:12:56.041 --> 00:12:59.311
randomly expedited over the weekend,
moved up the docket by years at a time

00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:01.480
in some cases,
with attorneys for those migrants saying

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.884
that this looks like an attempt
by the Trump DHS to reject Somali asylum

00:13:04.884 --> 00:13:06.585
applications without court hearings, fast

00:13:06.585 --> 00:13:08.854
tracking their deportation
and limiting due process.

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:11.190
it's now they're just scrambling
many lawyers going from zero

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.559
hearings on their calendars
to dozens, with many of those

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:15.861
also being a conflicting times
across several states.

00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:17.163
and of course, you know, it's hard
not to notice

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:20.065
that the cases that were expedited
were specifically Somali cases.

00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:20.466
know, this group

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.368
that Trump and his cronies
have most recently targeted

00:13:22.368 --> 00:13:24.904
with hateful rhetoric
and with all this, you had one immigration

00:13:24.904 --> 00:13:26.806
attorney saying,
I haven't seen a demographic pool

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:29.341
like this where they are targeting
specific nationalities.

00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:30.543
saying this feels like a setup to

00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:34.046
to rush these particular cases with judges
who may not be familiar with them.

00:13:34.046 --> 00:13:35.781
It's disappointing that their system isn't

00:13:35.781 --> 00:13:37.516
going to give them
their full day in court.

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:40.519
and so all of this has led to judges
rapidly losing their patience with Ice

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:43.923
and the DOJ, resulting in threats
of contempt charges and even sanctions.

00:13:43.923 --> 00:13:45.858
writing some two dozen cases
just in Minnesota,

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:46.659
judges are thrown around

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:49.895
terms like contempt and noncompliance
to get the government's attention

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:51.130
because surprise, surprise,

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.266
Team Trump really isn't complying
with judicial orders, especially in cases

00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:57.636
where an immigrant was unlawfully arrested
and must immediately be released.

00:13:57.636 --> 00:13:58.804
this isn't some small problem.

00:13:58.804 --> 00:14:01.607
The chief judge of Minnesota state court,
Judge Patrick Schultz,

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:04.777
he found that Ice had violated
nearly 100 judicial edicts.

00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:04.877
right.

00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:05.311
He added that

00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:09.048
that is probably an undercount, saying
Ice is likely violated more court orders

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:13.419
in January 2026 than some federal agencies
have violated in their entire existence.

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:14.920
understand it's not just Schultz.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.389
We've seen other judges
speaking out against the issue as well.

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:19.491
we're saying things like
this is clearly not tenable.

00:14:19.491 --> 00:14:21.293
I can't continue
to have federal prosecutors

00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:22.962
violating really important orders.

00:14:22.962 --> 00:14:25.264
If somebody should be released,
that has to happen.

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:27.933
you have a Georgetown law professor
saying that these types of threats,

00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:31.570
they're rare, but adding it's become
almost routine under this administration.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.138
now, with all that, right
as of this moment,

00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:35.140
no sanctions
or contempt charges of actually happened.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.043
But this is a situation that is
very rapidly reaching a boiling point.

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:40.312
Where even saw Schultz
planning on pulling in Head of Ice

00:14:40.312 --> 00:14:41.747
Todd Lyons last month to explain

00:14:41.747 --> 00:14:44.750
why he shouldn't be held in contempt
for the noncompliance on his watch.

00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:46.819
well, in that case,
the hearing got canceled after ice

00:14:46.819 --> 00:14:48.821
finally released
the immigrant detainee in question

00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:50.556
at the time, Schultz made it very clear

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:52.825
that the threat of contempt
wasn't off the table entirely.

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:54.159
saying the court warns Ice that future

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:57.296
noncompliance with court orders
may result in future show cause orders

00:14:57.296 --> 00:15:00.466
requiring the personal appearance of Lyons
or other government officials.

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:03.068
actually today you had Lyons
finding himself in the hot seat. right.

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:04.937
The House
Homeland Security Committee held a hearing

00:15:04.937 --> 00:15:07.373
grilling Lyons and other members
of the Trump administration,

00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:09.508
only pledged to provide reports
into the killings of Rene.

00:15:09.508 --> 00:15:10.542
Good. And Alex.

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:12.912
He also refused to apologize
to their families.

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:14.780
with all that, you had Representative
Eric Swalwell

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.849
line of questioning,
getting probably the most attention here.

00:15:16.849 --> 00:15:19.385
Julian's.
Will you apologize to the family of René?

00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:22.454
Good for being called a domestic terrorist

00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:25.457
by the president and his leadership.

00:15:25.457 --> 00:15:26.492
No, sir. Why not?

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.963
Sir, I welcome the opportunity
to speak to the family in private.

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:33.065
But I'm not going to comment
on any active investigation.

00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:35.734
We apologize to the family of Alex Preti
for also being called

00:15:35.734 --> 00:15:37.836
a domestic terrorist.

00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:41.006
Sir, again, I'm not going to speak
to any ongoing investigation.

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:42.374
you then also had a heated exchange

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:45.511
when Swalwell started
asking lines about firing Ice agents.

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:48.614
How many Ice agents have been fired
for their conduct under your leadership?

00:15:49.715 --> 00:15:51.917
Sir, I can get you that data.

00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:52.985
I'll get that back to you.

00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:54.853
Is it more than one?

00:15:54.853 --> 00:15:56.588
I am not going to speak
about personnel actions.

00:15:56.588 --> 00:15:58.624
But I will get you that data.

00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:00.492
Can you tell us if at least.

00:16:00.492 --> 00:16:01.994
God, I hope at least one person

00:16:01.994 --> 00:16:04.997
has been fired for their conduct
since these operations have begun.

00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:07.800
Are you telling us you can't even say one
person has been fired?

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.502
Sir, I'm not going to talk about personnel
actions, but we will get back to you.

00:16:10.502 --> 00:16:12.204
But two people have been killed so far.

00:16:12.204 --> 00:16:13.272
now. For his part, Lyons

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:16.175
repeatedly referred to attacks
against Ice agents and law enforcement,

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:17.343
but that ended up really only

00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:20.546
inviting even more scrutiny
with representative Dan Goldman saying.

00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:26.652
You said in your opening statement
that references to Ice as the Gestapo

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:31.156
or the secret police encourages
threats against Ice agents.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:31.790
100%.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.760
Problem is, you have it backwards, sir.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.496
People are simply making valid

00:16:37.496 --> 00:16:40.766
observations about your tactics,

00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:44.603
which are un-American
and outright fascist.

00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:47.940
So I have a simple suggestion.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.943
If you don't want to be called

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:56.515
a fascist regime or secret police,
then stop acting like one.

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:57.049
that actually wasn't

00:16:57.049 --> 00:16:59.451
even the biggest condemnation
that Lyons faced, because you had

00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:03.155
representative Lamonica McIvor basically
saying that he was going to go to hell.

00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:06.225
Mr. Lyons,
do you consider yourself a religious man?

00:17:06.492 --> 00:17:07.359
Yes, ma'am.

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.360
Oh, yes.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.097
Okay, well, how do you think Judgment Day
will work for you with so

00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:13.332
much blood on your hands?

00:17:14.733 --> 00:17:15.934
I'm not going to entertain that question.

00:17:15.934 --> 00:17:17.102
Oh, okay. Of course not.

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:19.038
Do you think you're going to hell, Mr.
Lyons?

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:21.140
I'm not going to. And of course not.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.441
so generally like this, this hearing

00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:25.177
it painted a very clear picture
of lawmakers frustrations with ice.

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:26.912
and actually, on that note,
it appears that Democrats

00:17:26.912 --> 00:17:29.882
are even willing to send DHS
into a shutdown over Ice funding.

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.451
Now, because Congress is facing a Friday
deadline to fund the department.

00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:35.621
But some lawmakers say that they don't
want to pass another continuing resolution

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:38.891
to keep it afloat, as they are demanding
real changes with immigration enforcement.

00:17:38.957 --> 00:17:41.827
you're seeing people like Senator Angus
King and independent from Maine telling

00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:45.397
NBC, Ice is doing is unconscionable,
and it's got to be reined in.

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:47.166
I can't in good conscience vote for

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:48.801
I would feel complicit
in what they are doing.

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:51.170
you know, King statement
here, it's being seen as a big deal

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.939
because he's one of eight senators
whose vote is really, really crucial.

00:17:53.939 --> 00:17:55.908
now that's ahead
as far as how things currently stand.

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:58.777
Negotiations between both parties
in the white House, they're ongoing.

00:17:58.777 --> 00:18:00.646
last week,
you had Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer

00:18:00.646 --> 00:18:02.614
sending a letter to Republicans
with a list of demands

00:18:02.614 --> 00:18:06.085
asking that agents no longer wear
masks or enter homes without warrants,

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:09.188
and that they wear body cameras
IDs and stop racial profiling.

00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:12.424
you had Republicans calling those demands
unrealistic and unserious.

00:18:12.424 --> 00:18:15.027
so then no surprise you had Democrats
rejecting the plan that Republicans

00:18:15.027 --> 00:18:17.229
sent forward this week,
with both Schumer and Jeffries

00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:20.766
shutting it down and saying that it is
both incomplete and insufficient in terms

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:24.002
of addressing the concerns that Americans
have about ICE's lawless conduct.

00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:27.005
you know, because there's been such
a massive public outrage against Ice

00:18:27.005 --> 00:18:30.008
recently, Democrats, they appear
to be emboldened to stand their ground.

00:18:30.008 --> 00:18:32.444
where recent polling has even show
that over 60% of Americans

00:18:32.444 --> 00:18:34.379
believe that the agency
has just gone too far,

00:18:34.379 --> 00:18:35.781
and they're making the country less safe.

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:38.050
And only 34% approve of their actions.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.119
and so with all that, you had Senator
Chris Murphy saying,

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:41.353
don't think there's a lot of interest

00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:43.889
in continuing defund this agency
that's out of control,

00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:47.426
killing American citizens, tear
gassing elementary schools without reform.

00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:49.995
are going to get killed. More
people are going to get killed.

00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:51.864
If we continue to fund DHS.

00:18:51.864 --> 00:18:52.464
and then as far as, you know,

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:55.734
what happens if the Friday deadline passes
with no deal in sight? Yes.

00:18:55.734 --> 00:18:59.338
You know, the shutdown only impacts DHS,
but DHS is umbrella.

00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:01.507
It still includes agencies
like TSA and FEMA.

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:03.642
meanwhile, ice itself
actually would probably continue

00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:06.745
operating as it already got $75 billion
in funding last year.

00:19:06.745 --> 00:19:08.447
but for the Democrats right now,
it really appears

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:09.748
to be the principle of the matter.

00:19:09.748 --> 00:19:11.850
bro, with everything
that's going on, ice at the very least

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.152
needs to fundamentally change

00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:15.687
if it's going to get even more cash
patting its budget.

00:19:15.687 --> 00:19:19.057
then finally today from that, I want
to end today's show with congratulations.

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:22.027
And one more thing.
so first, congratulations to Octavio M.C.

00:19:22.027 --> 00:19:24.596
geeks Ladies Weekly
winner who just scored $500 and tickets

00:19:24.596 --> 00:19:27.266
and is going to go see blasted their
first Dallas show. for the rest of y'all.

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:27.599
That's right.

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:29.968
Psychic is still giving away
$500 and tickets.

00:19:29.968 --> 00:19:31.803
And you should definitely enter today
if you haven't already,

00:19:31.803 --> 00:19:34.940
You could be the next winner and snag $500
towards seeing your favorite artist,

00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:35.941
sporting event or play.

00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:37.809
I mean, there's like over 70,000 events
to choose from.

00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:38.610
hey, just add code

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:42.080
DeFranco to your SeatGeek app profile
for a chance of the weekly $500 prize.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.115
No purchase necessary.

00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:45.083
But then the final thing
that we need to talk about

00:19:45.083 --> 00:19:48.887
today is Israel is finally, once
and for all, taking over the West Bank.

00:19:48.887 --> 00:19:49.454
right. That's what you're saying.

00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:51.323
A lot of people
saying about these new policies

00:19:51.323 --> 00:19:54.259
approved by Israeli PM Netanyahu
security cabinet over the weekend,

00:19:54.259 --> 00:19:55.527
some saying that they amount

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:58.630
to open defiance of Donald Trump,
stated opposition to annexation.

00:19:58.697 --> 00:20:00.732
all of this is covert,
as the IDF is reportedly getting ready

00:20:00.732 --> 00:20:04.269
for a new offensive in the Gaza, possibly
throwing a wrench into Trump's peace plan

00:20:04.269 --> 00:20:07.339
just as his peacekeeping force
that he promised seems to be taking shape.

00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:08.540
but starting with the West Bank.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.376
Notably, Netanyahu avoided
making the announcement himself.

00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:13.579
Instead, he left that job
to two government ministers

00:20:13.579 --> 00:20:16.949
who run the country's West Bank policy,
including the far right finance minister.

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:18.083
That's a little smoke rich.

00:20:18.083 --> 00:20:18.784
man who once said

00:20:18.784 --> 00:20:21.920
that the starvation of millions in Gaza
might be justified and moral,

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.189
and who is also otherwise
been the Israeli official,

00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:26.558
probably most aggressively pushing
for a West Bank takeover.

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:29.895
you had him again, making his intention
crystal clear, saying in a statement,

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:31.763
are deepening our roots in all parts

00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:35.100
of the land of Israel and burying
the idea of a Palestinian state.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.302
and with that, the bulk of any future
Palestinian state

00:20:37.302 --> 00:20:38.403
would be made up of the West

00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:41.473
Bank and East Jerusalem,
which were captured by Israel in 1967.

00:20:41.473 --> 00:20:44.042
and they're now home
to more than 3 million Palestinians,

00:20:44.042 --> 00:20:46.878
along with roughly 700,000 Israelis
living in settlements

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:49.348
that the international community
overwhelmingly considers illegal.

00:20:49.348 --> 00:20:51.416
though, there
you also have the government retroactively

00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:54.886
authorizing settler outpost
considered illegal even under Israeli law.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.122
also, I guess until now,
at least one thing

00:20:57.122 --> 00:20:58.156
standing in the way is settlement.

00:20:58.156 --> 00:21:01.260
Expansion has been a decades old law
banning the sale of property in the West

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:05.097
Bank to anyone besides local residents,
with local here referring to Palestinian,

00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:07.532
that's a rule
that actually goes back to before 1967,

00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:10.035
when Jordan controlled the territory
and it stayed in place

00:21:10.035 --> 00:21:11.036
because international law

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:14.039
says that an occupying country
cannot change existing legislation

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:16.808
except for security reasons
or the benefit of the local population.

00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:20.078
despite that, the measures approved
by the security cabinet include repealing

00:21:20.078 --> 00:21:21.747
that law, essentially making it possible

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:24.016
for Israelis to buy land
anywhere in the West Bank. right.

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:25.717
Among the things
that opponents of this plan fear

00:21:25.717 --> 00:21:28.086
is that settlement groups with deep
pockets are going to take advantage

00:21:28.086 --> 00:21:30.289
by buying property
deep inside the enclave.

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:31.089
which would then leave

00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:34.459
the Israeli government with no choice
but to also move deeper into the territory

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:37.296
because the military is obligated
to protect Israelis wherever they are.

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:38.930
also with that, that's not the only way

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.199
the security cabinet has paved
the way for annexation.

00:21:41.199 --> 00:21:43.402
they're also repealing a requirement
for a transaction

00:21:43.402 --> 00:21:45.170
permit before closing a land purchase.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:46.471
and that's important
because these permits,

00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:49.574
they've at least somewhat help tackle
the relatively widespread use of forgeries

00:21:49.574 --> 00:21:52.577
and other fraudulent methods
as a means of buying property

00:21:52.577 --> 00:21:54.479
from Palestinians
who didn't actually want to sell.

00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:55.981
Also,
another big thing is that land records

00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:58.417
that have until now been sealed
will be open to the public.

00:21:58.417 --> 00:22:00.719
this has actually been a key goal
of the settlement movement for a while,

00:22:00.719 --> 00:22:03.088
with the reason
being that it'll make it easier for them

00:22:03.088 --> 00:22:05.691
to track down Palestinians
who might be willing to sell, their

00:22:05.691 --> 00:22:08.894
I'll say notably, that might also end up
putting Palestinian lives at risk.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.263
That's because there's a law enforced
by the Palestinian Authority

00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:13.832
that actually makes selling land to Jews
punishable by death.

00:22:13.832 --> 00:22:17.002
then also beyond everything
related to buying and selling land,

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:18.870
the Israeli government is now
also asserting

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.472
radio control across the West Bank. Right.

00:22:20.472 --> 00:22:22.974
The 1993 Oslo
Accords left the Palestinian Authority

00:22:22.974 --> 00:22:25.477
administrative power
over about 40% of the West Bank.

00:22:25.477 --> 00:22:27.646
now, according to Netanyahu's
security cabinet,

00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:29.681
in apparent violation of that agreement,

00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:31.917
even those areas
will fall under Israeli control

00:22:31.917 --> 00:22:32.951
when it comes to the management

00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:36.088
of heritage and archeological sites,
environmental hazards and water.

00:22:36.088 --> 00:22:37.656
with that,
you have Israeli enforcement agencies

00:22:37.656 --> 00:22:39.991
claiming the power
to destroy any Palestinian structures

00:22:39.991 --> 00:22:42.127
deemed to be violating laws
in these domains.

00:22:42.127 --> 00:22:44.229
of course, with that,
you have activists arguing that Israel

00:22:44.229 --> 00:22:46.598
could find any excuse
to carry out the demolitions.

00:22:46.598 --> 00:22:48.867
similarly, you have them saying that
the security cabinet calling

00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:49.868
for more involvement

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:52.971
in major Palestinian cities
is just a pretext for greater control.

00:22:52.971 --> 00:22:56.208
in Hebron, for example, the largest city
in the West Bank, the Israeli military

00:22:56.208 --> 00:22:59.511
will take over planning and construction
in the area of a small Jewish settlement.

00:22:59.511 --> 00:22:59.578
Right.

00:22:59.578 --> 00:23:02.147
There are fears that this will lead
not only to settlement expansions, but

00:23:02.147 --> 00:23:06.084
also unwelcome changes at a religious site
that is sacred to both Muslims and Jews.

00:23:06.084 --> 00:23:09.354
also similarly, in Bethlehem,
a new Israeli agency will be set up to run

00:23:09.354 --> 00:23:12.924
Rachel's Tomb, another holy site shared
by the major monotheistic religions.

00:23:12.924 --> 00:23:16.027
then, of course, you know, with all this,
the backlash has been very, very big.

00:23:16.027 --> 00:23:16.261
Where you at?

00:23:16.261 --> 00:23:19.297
Eight Muslim majority countries, mostly
in the Middle East and North Africa, but

00:23:19.297 --> 00:23:22.601
also including Indonesia signing
a joint statement condemning the changes.

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:23.635
they also accused Netanyahu's

00:23:23.635 --> 00:23:26.204
government of accelerating attempts
at its illegal annexation

00:23:26.204 --> 00:23:27.806
and the displacement
of the Palestinian people.

00:23:27.806 --> 00:23:29.508
And you also had a high ranking official

00:23:29.508 --> 00:23:31.543
with the Palestinian Authority
calling on the Arab League,

00:23:31.543 --> 00:23:33.945
the Organization of Islamic Cooperation
and the U.N.

00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:35.414
Security Council to take action.

00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:36.681
right now, at least it's not clear

00:23:36.681 --> 00:23:39.284
what any of those bodies can really do,
though you did have U.N.

00:23:39.284 --> 00:23:42.487
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres
urging Israel to backtrack,

00:23:42.521 --> 00:23:45.490
with them noting that existing Israeli
settlements in the West Bank, including

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:49.194
in East Jerusalem, are already in flagrant
violation of international law.

00:23:49.227 --> 00:23:51.930
And you also have just so many experts
agreeing with the security cabinet's

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.833
latest moves are just the latest
in a long list of violations.

00:23:54.833 --> 00:23:55.600
you know, with that in mind,

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.569
this is really just
a continuation of a strategy

00:23:57.569 --> 00:24:00.172
that Netanyahu's government
has been pursuing for years, one

00:24:00.172 --> 00:24:03.108
that really just picked up
speed since October 7th, 2023.

00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:05.243
I mean, in that time,
the government has approved dozens

00:24:05.243 --> 00:24:08.547
of new settlements, including the largest
single expansion since 1993.

00:24:08.547 --> 00:24:09.748
and last year, according to the U.N.,

00:24:09.748 --> 00:24:12.818
they had the fastest rate of settlement
expansion since monitoring began.

00:24:12.818 --> 00:24:14.686
there's also been record
setting settler violence

00:24:14.686 --> 00:24:16.822
and military operations
have resulted in the largest

00:24:16.822 --> 00:24:20.058
displacement of Palestinian civilians
in the territory since 1967.

00:24:20.058 --> 00:24:20.892
all of that having happened

00:24:20.892 --> 00:24:22.294
already, is key to why
what we're seeing now

00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:25.096
is being described by many Palestinians
as de facto annexation.

00:24:25.096 --> 00:24:25.797
with all that said,

00:24:25.797 --> 00:24:28.667
it's not clear yet when these new policies
are meant to go into effect.

00:24:28.667 --> 00:24:30.802
and there's technically still a chance
for anti

00:24:30.802 --> 00:24:32.537
settlement groups
to challenge them in court.

00:24:32.537 --> 00:24:34.906
but also you had even people
belonging to those groups

00:24:34.906 --> 00:24:36.441
saying that the chances are pretty slim.

00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:38.276
the potentially one thing
that could actually have

00:24:38.276 --> 00:24:40.445
an impact is opposition
from the United States.

00:24:40.445 --> 00:24:42.047
are you Trump saying last year
that he wouldn't

00:24:42.047 --> 00:24:45.383
allow Israel to annex the West
Bank, telling time magazine won't happen

00:24:45.383 --> 00:24:47.319
because I gave my word to the Arab
countries,

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:50.121
Israel would lose all of its support
from the United States if that happened.

00:24:50.121 --> 00:24:53.558
but at the same time, you people arguing
that what Israel is doing is an outright

00:24:53.558 --> 00:24:55.460
annexation,
you've got people like the former head

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.829
of Palestinian affairs
and Israeli military intelligence

00:24:57.829 --> 00:24:58.830
telling the New York Times that

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:02.033
this may all be a way for the government
to advance the annexation agenda,

00:25:02.033 --> 00:25:05.270
while also avoiding open confrontation
with Donald Trump, saying I define it

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:09.040
as taking steps toward annexation
without saying the word annexation.

00:25:09.107 --> 00:25:11.243
with all that, while
an unnamed white House official reportedly

00:25:11.243 --> 00:25:14.212
reiterated Trump's opposition
toward Israel annexing the West Bank,

00:25:14.212 --> 00:25:17.215
there's been no statement condemning
or even addressing the new measures

00:25:17.215 --> 00:25:18.850
approved by Israel's security cabinet.

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.052
while Netanyahu is set to travel
to the United States

00:25:21.052 --> 00:25:22.888
and meet with Trump
at the white House tomorrow, it seems like

00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:24.856
the focus of their conversation
there will be Iran.

00:25:24.856 --> 00:25:26.391
but also as that happens, there's a lot

00:25:26.391 --> 00:25:28.260
we got to talk about
with another occupied territory.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.127
And that is Gaza.

00:25:29.127 --> 00:25:32.063
Because you just had the Times of Israel
reporting that the Israeli military

00:25:32.063 --> 00:25:35.834
is drawing up plans for a new offensive
in Gaza to disarm Hamas once and for all.

00:25:35.834 --> 00:25:36.067
the. Well,

00:25:36.067 --> 00:25:38.236
so I'll say with that, as we've talked
about before, that the fighting

00:25:38.236 --> 00:25:40.205
has never really stopped, in fact,
just today,

00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:41.773
there were reports that an Israeli drone
strike

00:25:41.773 --> 00:25:44.175
killed two cyclists in Gaza,
which would just be the latest

00:25:44.175 --> 00:25:46.478
in hundreds of deaths
since the October cease fire began.

00:25:46.478 --> 00:25:48.947
that's in addition to that, many others
who have died for other reasons, like,

00:25:48.947 --> 00:25:51.016
for example,
you also had an Israeli court recently

00:25:51.016 --> 00:25:53.418
rejecting an appeal to allow a five year
old Palestinian boy

00:25:53.418 --> 00:25:56.555
with an aggressive form of cancer
enter Israel for lifesaving treatment.

00:25:56.555 --> 00:25:58.623
with that being because of a government
policy barring

00:25:58.623 --> 00:26:00.892
residents registered in Gaza
from crossing the border

00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:02.394
even when they no longer live there,

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:05.030
which is reportedly the case for this boy
who now lives in the West Bank.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.264
that's just one of many cases there.

00:26:06.264 --> 00:26:08.199
I mean, as of November,
there were reportedly as many

00:26:08.199 --> 00:26:11.336
as 11,000 Palestinian cancer
patients trapped in Gaza.

00:26:11.336 --> 00:26:13.338
you have the World Health Organization
saying around the same time

00:26:13.338 --> 00:26:16.641
that 900 people in need of outside
medical treatment, including children

00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:19.678
and cancer patients, they've already died
while waiting for evacuation.

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:21.246
then,
of course, with this, a new offensive,

00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:23.281
it could mean
things get even worse from here.

00:26:23.281 --> 00:26:23.982
especially as you had

00:26:23.982 --> 00:26:25.750
an official reportedly
telling The Times of Israel

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:28.320
that disarming Hamas
is likely to take many years.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.055
And the outlet explaining,
should hostilities

00:26:30.055 --> 00:26:32.157
or do fighting
is liable to be more intense

00:26:32.157 --> 00:26:34.993
and more widespread than previous rounds,
as Israeli forces

00:26:34.993 --> 00:26:38.430
will no longer be constrained
by the presence of hostages on Gazan soil.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:38.530
right.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:40.865
Also with the you're the paper
noting that getting back to large scale

00:26:40.865 --> 00:26:42.834
fighting could complicate Trump's
Gaza plan

00:26:42.834 --> 00:26:44.803
and threaten
the support of its international backers.

00:26:44.803 --> 00:26:47.472
that becomes even more notable
because you just had Indonesia announcing

00:26:47.472 --> 00:26:48.073
that it's getting ready

00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:51.242
to send up to 8000 troops to Gaza
to be part of the peacekeeping force.

00:26:51.242 --> 00:26:52.077
Under that plan.

00:26:52.077 --> 00:26:55.146
with the Indonesian president
saying the number of troops in that force

00:26:55.146 --> 00:26:57.215
will ultimately come out to around 20,000.

00:26:57.215 --> 00:26:58.950
But then, my friends,
you beautiful bastards, is

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.319
where your Tuesday
Philip DeFranco show is going to end.

00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:03.888
Thank you for being a part
of another daily dive into the news.

00:27:03.888 --> 00:27:05.690
Let me just say I love yo faces.

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.325
And I'll see you right back here tomorrow.
